One Skillet Quick Chicken Biryani

INGREDIENTS
¼ cup ghee
1 ½ pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into chunks
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 small onions, halved and thinly sliced
5 garlic cloves, minced
One 2-inch piece of ginger, minced
2 cups Swanson® Natural Goodness® Chicken Broth
2 teaspoons garam masala
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 ½ cups basmati rice, rinsed
¼ cup chopped cilantro
¼ cup thinly sliced almonds, toasted
½ cup dried apricots, finely diced
Lemon wedges, for serving

RECIPE PREPARATION
In a large heavy bottomed skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the ghee over medium-high. Season the chicken with salt and pepper and add in a single layer. Cook, turning halfway through until golden on both sides, about 6 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate.
Add the onions, remaining 2 tablespoons of ghee, and ¼ cup water to the skillet. Increase the heat to high. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up any brown bits on bottom of pan into onions to prevent the bits from burning. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are deep golden, adding a few tablespoons of water if bottom of pan gets dark and scraping up brown bits, about 10 minutes. Remove half the onions to a bowl.
Reduce heat to medium, add the garlic and ginger to the remaining onions in the skillet. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the garam masala and turmeric and cook, stirring, 30 seconds.
Pour in the Swanson® Natural Goodness® Chicken Broth, return the chicken and add the rice and 3/4 teaspoon salt to the skillet. Stir to combine. Bring to a boil and cover skillet with lid. Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
Remove skillet from oven and fluff the chicken and rice with a fork. Season with salt and pepper. Top with reserved onions, cilantro, apricot, and almonds. Serve with lemon wedges.
