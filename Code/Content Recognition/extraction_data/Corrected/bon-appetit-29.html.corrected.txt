Ginger-Citrus Cookies

Ingredients
2 cups 1"–2"-wide strips lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit zest (pith removed)
2 cups granulated sugar
1 tsp. ground ginger
½ tsp. ground cardamom
½ tsp. ground cinnamon
¼ tsp. ground cloves
3½ cups all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp. baking soda
1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt
½ tsp. freshly ground white pepper
10 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature
1 cup granulated sugar
½ cup (packed) light brown sugar
2 large eggs
¾ cup mild-flavored (light) molasses

Preparation
Place citrus zest in a medium saucepan and pour in cold water to cover. Bring to a boil; drain. Repeat process 2 more times.
Combine sugar and 2 cups water in same saucepan; bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add citrus zest and bring just to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer very gently until peels are translucent, 30–45 minutes. Remove from heat and let citrus zest cool in syrup.
Drain citrus zest and finely chop. Spread out on a rimmed baking sheet; let sit until dry.
Preheat oven to 350°. Toast ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Sift toasted spices, flour, baking soda, salt, and white pepper into a medium bowl or onto a sheet of wax paper.
Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter and both sugars in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Beat in molasses. Gradually add dry ingredient in 2 batches, beating on low speed to incorporate after each addition. Stir in 1 cup candied citrus peel.
Drop dough by rounded tablespoons between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2" apart. Bake cookies until tops feel firm when lightly touched, 10–12 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets about 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.
