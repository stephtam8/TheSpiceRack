Collard Greens Salad With Pickled Fennel and Coconut

Ingredients
½ cup white wine vinegar
⅓ cup sugar
2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt
2 garlic cloves, smashed
1 bay leaf (optional)
1 medium fennel bulb, stalks and tough outer layer removed, thinly sliced lengthwise
1 jalapeño, halved lengthwise
2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
2 jalapeños, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 cup unsweetened coconut flakes
Kosher salt
1 large egg yolk*
½ cup unsweetened coconut milk
3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
2 tsp. Dijon mustard
1 tsp. toasted sesame oil
1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
Kosher salt
2 bunches collard greens, stems removed, leaves very thinly sliced (about 5 cups packed)
½ small head Napa cabbage, tough stems removed, very thinly sliced (about 2 cups)
1 small head radicchio, halved through core, very thinly sliced (about 2 cups)
¾ cup crumbled farmer’s cheese

Preparation
PICKLED FENNEL
Bring vinegar, sugar, salt, garlic, bay leaf (if using), and 1 cup water to a simmer over medium-high heat. Let cool 5 minutes. Add fennel and jalapeño and let cool completely. Cover and chill at least 2 hours before using.
Do ahead: Fennel can be pickled 1 week ahead. Keep chilled.
COCONUT TOPPING
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium. Cook jalapeños, garlic, and coconut flakes, stirring often, until garlic and coconut turn golden, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and transfer to a small bowl.
DRESSING AND ASSEMBLY
Blend egg yolk, coconut milk, lemon juice, olive oil, mustard, sesame oil, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender until smooth and creamy; season dressing with salt.
Place collard greens, cabbage, and radicchio in a large bowl. Drizzle dressing over, season with salt, and toss to coat. Add cheese and pickled fennel and gently toss again; scatter coconut topping over.
