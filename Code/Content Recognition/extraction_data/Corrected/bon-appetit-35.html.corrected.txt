All-Dressed-Up Cauliflower Rice

Ingredients
1 medium head of cauliflower (about 2¼ lb.), broken into florets
2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1 medium red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 shallot, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely grated
1 Tbsp. curry powder
1 tsp. ground turmeric
½ tsp. ground coriander
¾ cup canned unsweetened coconut milk
1 tsp. finely grated lime zest
1 Tbsp. fresh lime juice
1 tsp. coconut sugar or granulated sugar
Kosher salt
¼ cup golden raisins
¼ cup coarsely chopped cilantro
¼ cup unsalted, roasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas)
¼ cup coarsely chopped mint, plus torn leaves for serving
Plain whole-milk Greek yogurt and lime wedges (for serving; optional)

Preparation
Working in 2 batches, pulse cauliflower in a food processor until pieces are about the size of rice (you don’t want to overprocess; err on the large side). Transfer cauliflower to a medium bowl lined with a kitchen towel to absorb any extra moisture.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add bell pepper, shallot, and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallot and garlic are softened slightly, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle in curry powder, turmeric, and coriander and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add coconut milk, lime zest, lime juice, and coconut sugar; season with salt. Reduce heat to medium-low; cook, stirring, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Add cauliflower and raisins; cook, tossing occasionally, until cauliflower is just tender, about 3 minutes. Taste and season with more salt if needed.
Add cilantro, pumpkin seeds, and ¼ cup mint to cauliflower rice and toss to combine. Divide among bowls; top with a dollop of yogurt if using and torn mint. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over if desired.
