Saucy Spiced Cod With Corn

Ingredients
5 Tbsp. unsalted butter
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1½ tsp. coriander seeds
¾ tsp. cumin seeds
¾ tsp. mild red pepper flakes or ½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
½ tsp. ground turmeric
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
1 tsp. soy sauce
3 ears of corn, husked, kernels removed from cobs (about 3 cups)
4 5–6-oz. cod or other flaky whitefish fillets
Mint leaves and toasted sesame seeds (for serving)

Preparation
Melt butter in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat. Add garlic, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds and cook, swirling pan often, until butter is foaming and spices are very fragrant, about 2 minutes (reduce heat if butter is starting to brown). Add red pepper flakes, turmeric, a big pinch of salt, and several grinds of pepper. Cook, swirling pan, until very fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ½ cup water (careful, it may spatter a bit), then soy sauce.
Add corn to skillet. Season fish lightly with salt and nestle into corn and broth; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently until fish flakes easily with a fork, 7–9 minutes.
Divide fish among bowls. Taste broth and season with more salt if needed. Divide corn and broth among bowls and top with mint and sesame seeds.
