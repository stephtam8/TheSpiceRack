TOMATO LENTIL SOUP

INGREDIENTS
2 Tbsp olive oil 
1 yellow onion 
3 carrots 
2 cloves garlic 
1 russet potato (about 1 lb.) 
2 Tbsp tomato paste 
2 15oz. cans stewed tomatoes ($1.18)
1 cup brown lentils 
½ tsp paprika 
½ tsp dried basil 
½ tsp dried oregano 
¼ tsp freshly cracked black pepper 
4 cups vegetable broth 
2 Tbsp soy sauce 

INSTRUCTIONS
Dice the onion, mince the garlic, and slice the carrots (I like smaller pieces for this recipe, so I do a quarter round slice). Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and olive oil to a large soup pot and sauté over medium heat until the oniosn are soft. While the vegetables are cooking, peel and dice the potato into ½-inch cubes.
Add the tomato paste and continue to sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until the tomato paste begins to coat the bottom of the pot.
Add the cubed potato, stewed tomatoes (with juices), lentils, paprika, basil, oregano, pepper, and vegetable broth to the pot. Stir to combine.
Place a lid on top and allow the soup to come up to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the soup simmer for about 40 minutes or until the lentils are super tender and have begun to break down slightly (this helps thicken the soup).
Add the soy sauce to the soup, then give it a taste and adjust the salt if needed (the total amount will depend on the salt content of your vegetable broth). Serve hot with crusty bread for dipping.
