HONEY BALSAMIC GLAZED CARROTS

INGREDIENTS
2 lbs. carrots 
1 Tbsp olive oil 
1/4 tsp salt 
1/4 tsp pepper 
2 Tbsp honey 
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar 
1 Tbsp butter 

INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Wash and/or peel the carrots, then cut them into one-inch pieces.
Place the carrots on a parchment lined baking sheet and drizzle with 1 Tbsp olive oil. Add ¼ salt, ¼ tsp pepper, and toss the carrots until coated. Transfer the carrots to the oven and roast for 30 minutes, stirring once half-way through.
While the carrots are roasting, prepare the honey balsamic glaze. Add the honey and balsamic vinegar to a small sauce pot and stir to combine. Simmer the glaze over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, or until it has reduced and thickened slightly. Remove the pot from the heat, then add the butter. Stir until the butter has melted into the glaze. Set the glaze aside.
When the carrots are finished roasting, drizzle the honey balsamic glaze over top and toss to coat. Serve warm!
