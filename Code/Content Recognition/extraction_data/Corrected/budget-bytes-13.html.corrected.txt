QUICK TOFU STIR FRY

INGREDIENTS
3 Tbsp soy sauce 
2 Tbsp brown sugar 
2 Tbsp water 
1 tsp toasted sesame oil 
2 cloves garlic, minced 
1 tsp freshly grated ginger 
2 Tbsp cooking oil 
14 oz. extra firm tofu 
1/4 cup chopped peanuts 
Â½ lb. coleslaw mix (shredded cabbage and carrots) 
2 green onions, sliced 
1 Tbsp sriracha (optional) 

INSTRUCTIONS
Prepare the stir fry sauce first. In a bowl combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, water, toasted sesame oil, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Set the sauce aside.
Slice the green onion and chop the peanuts.
Take the tofu out of the package, draining away any liquid from the package (no need to press the tofu as the water will be cooked out). Crumble the tofu into a bowl.
Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Once the skillet and oil are very hot, add the crumbled tofu and stir fry for about 5 minutes, or until there is no longer any water pooling on the bottom of the skillet.
Add the prepared stir fry sauce to the skillet and continue to cook and stir for 2-3 minutes more. Finally, add the slaw mix and chopped peanuts and stir fry for 1-2 minutes more, or just until the cabbage begins to wilt. Top with sliced green onions and a drizzle of sriracha, then serve!
