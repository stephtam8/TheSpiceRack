SWEET POTATO CORNBREAD

INGREDIENTS
1 lb. sweet potato 
1.5 cups yellow cornmeal 
1 cup all-purpose flour 
1/2 cup sugar 
1 Tbsp baking powder 
1 tsp salt 
1/2 tsp cinnamon 
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg 
2 large eggs 
1/2 cup sour cream 
3/4 cup milk 
2 Tbsp cooking oil 
1/2 Tbsp cooking oil for the skillet 

INSTRUCTIONS
Peel the sweet potato and cut it into one-inch cubes. Place the cubes in a pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes until they're tender and fall apart with pierced with a fork (about ten minutes). Drain the potatoes and set aside.
Coat the inside of a 10" cast iron skillet with cooking oil. Place the skillet in the oven and begin to preheat the oven to 425ÂºF.
In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg until well mixed.
Mash the drained sweet potatoes until fairly smooth. Transfer 1.5 cups of the mashed potatoes to a large bowl. Add the sour cream, milk, and 2 Tbsp oil, and whisk until combined. Add the eggs and whisk until combined again.
Pour the sweet potato mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Stir the two together just until combined and no dry mix remains on the bottom of the bowl. It's okay if the mixture is a little lumpy, just be sure not to over mix.
Carefully take the hot skillet out of the preheated oven and scoop the batter into the skillet. Smooth out the top of the batter until it's even, then return it to the oven. Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until the center is puffed, the top is golden brown, and it's slightly cracked around the edges. Remove the cornbread from the oven, cut into eight pieces, and serve (preferably with butter).
