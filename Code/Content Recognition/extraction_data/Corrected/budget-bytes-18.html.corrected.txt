HONEY MUSTARD PORK CHOPS

INGREDIENTS
1/3 cup mayonnaise 
2 Tbsp Dijon mustard 
2 Tbsp honey 
1/8 tsp garlic powder 
1/4 tsp smoked paprika 
1/4 tsp salt 
1/4 tsp Freshly cracked pepper 
1 Tbsp cooking oil 
4 bone-in pork chops, one-inch thick (about 2.5 lbs.) 

INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 350ºF. Prepare the honey mustard sauce by stirring together the mayonnaise, Dijon, honey, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and freshly cracked black pepper.
Use a paper towel to dry off the surface of the pork chops, then season each side with a pinch of salt and freshly cracked pepper. Heat one tablespoon of cooking oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the skillet is very hot add two pork chops at a time and cook until golden brown on each side (3 minutes each side). Place the browned pork chops in a casserole dish (it's okay if they overlap slihtly).
Smear the honey mustard sauce over both sides of the pork chops in the casserole dish. Bake for about 30 minutes for 1-inch thick chops, about 20 minutes for ¾-inch thick chops, or until the internal temperature reaches 145ºF. To achieve more browning, switch the oven to broil and broil the chops for 3-5 minutes or until the surface is golden brown and bubbly. Serve hot.
