MARINATED CAULIFLOWER SALAD

INGREDIENTS
½ cup olive oil 
¼ cup red wine vinegar 
1 tsp Dijon mustard 
¼ tsp garlic powder 
1 Tbsp Italian seasoning 
½ tsp salt 
¼ tsp freshly cracked black pepper 
2 Tbsp grated Parmesan 
1 head cauliflower ($2.39)
1 2.25oz. can sliced black olives ($1.49)
½ 12oz. jar banana pepper rings 
1 red bell pepper ($1.50)
⅓ cup diced red onion 
2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley 

INSTRUCTIONS
Make the dressing first, so the flavors have time to blend. In a jar or bowl, combine the olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and Parmesan. Whisk the ingredients together or close the jar and shake until combined. Set the dressing aside.
Remove the leaves and stem from the cauliflower, then chop it into very small florets (about the size of a grape). Place the chopped cauliflower in a large bowl.
Drain the black olives and remove the banana peppers from the jar. Add both to the bowl with the cauliflower.
Dice the red bell pepper and finely dice the red onion and parsley. Add them to the bowl.
Pour the prepared dressing over the salad, then toss to combine. Refrigerate the salad for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to absorb. Stir again just before serving. This salad gets better as it refrigerates and the cauliflower has more time to marinate. Always stir just before serving to redistribute the flavors.
