GARLIC MARINATED CHICKEN

INGREDIENTS
1/4 cup olive oil 
1/4 cup lemon juice 
3 cloves garlic, minced 
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano 
1/2 tsp salt 
Freshly cracked pepper 
1.5 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts* 

INSTRUCTIONS
Add the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper to a bowl or a large zip top bag. Stir the ingredients in the dish until combined.
Filet each chicken breast into two thinner pieces. Place the pieces in the bag or in a shallow dish, then pour the marinade over top, making sure the chicken pieces are completely covered in marinade. Marinate the chicken for 30 minutes, or up to 8 hours (refrigerated), turning occasionally to maximize the chicken's contact with the marinade.
When ready to cook, heat a large skillet over medium. Transfer the chicken from the marinade to the hot skillet and cook on each side until well browned and cooked through (about 5-7 minutes each side, depending on the size of the pieces). Cook two pieces at a time to avoid overcrowding the skillet, which can cause juices to pool and prevents browning. Discard the excess marinade.
Transfer the cooked chicken from the skillet to a cutting board and let rest for five minutes before slicing and serving.
