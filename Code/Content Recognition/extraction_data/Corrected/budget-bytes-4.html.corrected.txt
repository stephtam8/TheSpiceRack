GARLIC HERB MASHED CAULIFLOWER

INGREDIENTS
1 head cauliflower 
2 Tbsp butter 
2 oz. cream cheese 
1 tsp dried parsley 
½ tsp dried oregano 
½ tsp dried basil 
¼ tsp onion powder 
¼ tsp garlic powder 
½ tsp salt 
⅛ tsp freshly cracked black pepper 

INSTRUCTIONS
Remove the stem and leaves from the cauliflower and cut it into florets (the smaller the florets, the faster they'll cook).
Add the cauliflower florets to a large pot and cover with water. Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat on to high. Bring the pot up to a boil, then continue to boil the cauliflower florets until they are VERY tender (about 10 minutes, test by piercing with a fork). Drain the cooked cauliflower in a colander.
While the cauliflower is boiling, prepare the garlic herb seasoning. Combine the dried parsley, dried oregano, dried basil, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl.
Add the cooked and drained cauliflower to a food processor. Pulse the cauliflower until the florets are broken up into tiny pieces. Then add the butter, cream cheese, and garlic herb seasoning. Purée until the mixture smooth. Taste and adjust the salt or other seasonings to your liking.
