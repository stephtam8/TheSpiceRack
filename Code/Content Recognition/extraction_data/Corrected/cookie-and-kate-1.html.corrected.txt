Gluten-Free Banana Bread (Made with Almond Flour)

INGREDIENTS
¼ cup melted coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil or high-quality vegetable oil
½ cup honey or maple syrup
4 large eggs
1 cup mashed ripe bananas (about 2 ½ medium or 2 large bananas)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon fine sea salt
2 ½ cups almond flour

INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Generously grease your loaf pan’s base and sides with cooking oil spray or butter, and generously flour it with almond flour. (Don’t skip this step, or your bread might stick! See photos.)
In a large mixing bowl, combine the oil and honey. Whisk until blended together. Add the eggs, and whisk until the mixture is thoroughly combined.
Add the mashed bananas, baking powder, vanilla, baking soda, cinnamon and salt, and whisk to combine.
Finally, add the almond flour. Switch to a large spoon or spatula, and stir until the flour is fully incorporated into the batter. Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan.
Bake for 55 to 65 minutes, until the center of the loaf is fairly springy to the touch and a toothpick comes out clean. Place the pan on a cooling rack to cool for at least 30 minutes (this bread is delicate while warm). Use a butter knife to loosen the edges of the bread from the pan, then carefully tip it over to release. Slice and serve!
