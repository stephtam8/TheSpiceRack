The New Old Fashioned Cocktail

INGREDIENTS
2 ounces bourbon (I like Four Roses)
½ to 1 teaspoon maple syrup, to taste
2 dashes Angostura bitters
Ice, preferably large cubes
Orange peel, for garnish
Optional: 1 Luxardo cherry or other cocktail cherry, for garnish

INSTRUCTIONS
In a lowball glass, pour in the bourbon, ½ teaspoon maple syrup and a couple dashes of bitters. Stir to combine.
Add a large ice cube or several small, and gently stir in a circular motion until the drink is very cold, about 20 seconds. Taste, and stir in ¼ to ½ teaspoon more maple syrup if you prefer a sweeter drink.
Use a vegetable peeler to remove a hefty strip of orange peel. Gently twist it, skin side down, over the drink to release the oils. Then place the orange peel in the glass. Enjoy.
