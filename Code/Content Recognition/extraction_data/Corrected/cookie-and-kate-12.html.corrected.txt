Creamy Golden Milk (Hot or Iced)

INGREDIENTS
1 cup raw, unsalted cashews (soaked for 4 hours or in the fridge overnight if you are not using a high-powered blender)
4 cups water, divided
1 tablespoon ground turmeric
1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
½ teaspoon ground cardamom
10 twists of freshly ground black pepper
Tiny pinch of fine salt
2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup
2 teaspoons vanilla extract

INSTRUCTIONS
Whether soaked or not, rinse the cashews until the water runs clear. In your blender, combine the cashews with 2 cups of the water. Add all of the remaining ingredients (turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, pepper, salt, honey and vanilla).
Start on a low setting and increase the speed until the cashews are blended into creamy oblivion. This could take 2 minutes in a high-powered blender or longer in a regular blender.
Blend in 2 cups more water until creamy. Taste, and if the mixture tastes too fiery, you can blend in a bit more sweetener (though the flavors seem to mellow a bit with time).
To serve cold, fill a drinking glass with ice and pour the golden milk on top. Or to serve warm, gently heat your desired quantity in a saucepan on the stove over medium-low heat until steaming, stirring often (don’t overdo it, or the texture won’t be as nice). Store leftover golden milk in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
