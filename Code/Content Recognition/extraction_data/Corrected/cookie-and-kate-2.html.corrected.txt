How to Make Flax “Eggs”

INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds,* also known as flaxseed meal
3 tablespoons water

INSTRUCTIONS
Combine the ground flax and water in a small bowl (if your recipe calls for multiple eggs, just multiply the ingredients as necessary and mix in the same bowl). Stir with a fork until combined.
Let the mixture rest for at least 10 to 15 minutes, until it’s somewhat “gloppy” or congealed. Use in place of the eggs in your baking project!
