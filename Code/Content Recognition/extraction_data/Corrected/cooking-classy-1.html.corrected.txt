Pork Loin Roast

Ingredients
3 - 4 lb pork loin*
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 Tbsp olive oil, divided
2 tsp chopped fresh thyme (or 3/4 tsp dried)
2 tsp chopped fresh rosemary (or 3/4 tsp dried)
2 tsp chopped fresh sage (or 3/4 tsp dried)
1 1/2 tsp minced garlic (4 cloves)
1 tsp lemon zest or orange zest (optional)
2 Tbsp butter or olive oil
2 Tbsp flour
Pan drippings from roasting pan
1 cup low-sodium chicken broth
2 Tbsp heavy cream, optional

Instructions
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat (I like to use cast iron for nice browning).
Dab pork loin dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.
Heat 1 Tbsp oil in skillet and brown pork on all sides, about 2 minutes per side (8 minutes total).
Transfer pork to a roasting pan. Let cool a few minutes so it's not too hot to handle.
Meanwhile in a small bowl stir together remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil with thyme, rosemary, sage, garlic and lemon zest.
Using hands spread mixture over roast (on all sides, note it doesn't stick perfectly well and that's ok if some falls from the sides, just sneak it under the roast to season it). Roast should be fat side up for baking.
Insert an oven probe thermometer into center of middle area of pork loin (if you don't have one use a standard probe thermometer to test temperature occasionally).
Bake pork in preheated oven until center registers 145 degrees on thermometer, about 50 - 70 minutes.
Remove from oven, transfer to carving board. Tent roast with foil and let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile prepare gravy.
