Instant Pot Mac and Cheese

Ingredients
2 1/4 cups water
1 (14.5 oz) can low-sodium chicken broth
16 oz. dry elbow macaroni pasta (recommend Barilla for consistent results)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/2 cup half and half, heated until just warm, plus more to thin as needed
3 Tbsp unsalted butter, diced into 1 Tbsp pieces
8 oz. (2 cup) shredded sharp cheddar cheese*
4 oz. (1 cup) shredded gruyere cheese (recommend Murray's)

Instructions
Pour water and chicken broth into Instant Pot. Add pasta, season with salt to taste and stir.
Cover securely with lid, set valve to sealing position. Set to manual pressure and 3 minutes. It will take about 10 minutes to come to pressure then time will start to count down.
Once time is up, turn instant pot off and carefully do a quick release (stand back it will steam intensely!). Once steaming has stopped completely and there's not pressure remaining remove lid.
Add butter and pour in half and half. Gently toss until butter has melted.
Add cheese and stir. Let it rest for 1 minute then toss until cheese has melted (if needed you can set Instant Pot to saute mode just briefly to help melt cheese). If needed thin with more half and half (it doesn't need to be warm).
Serve warm with pepper if desired. Let cool slightly to thicken if needed.
