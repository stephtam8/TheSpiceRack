Tortellini Soup

Ingredients
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 lb. lean ground beef
1 1/2 cups chopped yellow onion
1 cup diced celery
1 cup diced carrots
1 Tbsp minced garlic
3 (14.5 oz) cans low-sodium chicken broth
1 (14.5 oz) can petite diced tomatoes
3 (8 oz) cans tomato sauce
1 Tbsp Italian seasoning
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 (9 oz) pkg. cheese tortellini
2 cups (2 oz) spinach, roughly chopped
3 Tbsp minced fresh parsley

Instructions
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Crumble in beef in chunks and let cook until browned on bottom, about 3 minutes.
Turn and break up beef and continue to cook until no longer pink. Transfer beef to a paper towel lined plate while leaving 1 1/2 Tbsp fat in pot (or add 1 1/2 Tbsp olive oil and drain off fat).
Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot. Saute until starting to soften, about 7 minutes.
Add garlic and saute 1 minute longer.
Pour in chicken broth, tomatoes, tomato sauce, cooked beef, and season with Italian seasoning and salt and pepper to taste.
Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until veggies are nearly soft, about 15 minutes.
Add tortellini (see important note*) and let simmer according to time listed on package (usually about 4 - 7 minutes).
Stir in spinach and parsley. Serve warm.
