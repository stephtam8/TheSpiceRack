Chicken Scampi

Ingredients
1 1/4 lbs. boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into 1-inch pieces
2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
2 tsp Italian seasoning
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
8 Tbsp unsalted butter, diced into 1-Tbsp pieces
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp minced garlic (6 cloves)
12 oz. thin spaghetti (or standard)
1 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc
1/8 - 1/4 tsp Red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)
1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup chopped parsley
2/3 cup shredded parmesan cheese (or Romano cheese, for serving)

Instructions
Bring a large pot of water to a boil to cook pasta (cook according to directions on package, to al dente. I find it's best to start cooking the pasta in the boiling water when the wine is reducing just before step 7).
Dab chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Toss with flour, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper (I use about 3/4 tsp salt 1/4 tsp pepper).
Meanwhile melt 3 Tbsp butter with 1 Tbsp olive oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
Add chicken in a single layer and let sear until browned on bottom, about 4 minutes, turn and let cook through about 2 - 3 minutes.
Transfer chicken and butter mixture to a bowl or large plate. Tent with foil to keep warm.
Return pan to medium-low heat. Melt 1 Tbsp butter. Add garlic and saute about 20 seconds, don't brown it. (At this point, separately add pasta to boiling water to cook to al dente.)
Pour wine and red pepper flakes into butter garlic mixture in skillet and let simmer until reduced by about 3/4, about 5 minutes.
Add remaining 4 tbsp butter and let melt.
Remove from heat, stir in lemon juice. Return chicken to skillet and toss with sauce, season with salt and pepper as needed.
Toss drained pasta with chicken, sauce mixture, and parsley. Garnish servings with parmesan and serve warm.
