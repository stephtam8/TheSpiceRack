Chicken Tacos

Ingredients
1 1/2 lbs. boneless skinless chicken thighs (6 medium), trimmed of excess fat
2 Tbsp olive oil, divided
1 Tbsp lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving
2 1/2 tsp chili powder
1 1/2 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp smoked paprika
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
10 (6-inch) corn tortillas, warmed*
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1/3 cup chopped red onions or yellow onions
Other desired toppings (see notes)

Instructions
Place chicken in a medium mixing bowl. Pour over 1 Tbsp olive oil and lime juice.
Sprinkle with chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper and salt and pepper (I use about 1 tsp salt and 3/4 tsp pepper).
Toss mixture well until evenly coated. At this point you can use right away or marinate in the fridge for up to 8 hours.
Heat a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle in remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil.
Place chicken in skillet spacing evenly apart. Let cook until browned on bottom, about 6 minutes.
Turn chicken pieces, reduce heat to medium if needed. Continue to cook until chicken has cooked through (165 degrees in thickest portion), about 6 minutes longer.
Transfer to a cutting board and let rest a few minutes. Cut into pieces.
Layer chopped chicken over tortillas, sprinkle with desired toppings and onions and cilantro. Serve warm with lime wedges for spritzing over.
