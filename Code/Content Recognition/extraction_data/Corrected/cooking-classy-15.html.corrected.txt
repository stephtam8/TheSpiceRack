Cheesy Spaghetti Squash Recipe

Ingredients
6 - 6.5 lbs spaghetti squash (3 medium or 2 large), halved, scoop out seeds and membranes*
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp butter
1 1/2 Tbsp minced garlic (about 4 cloves)
1 Tbsp all-purpose flour
1 cup parmesan cheese (imported)
1 1/4 cups mozzarella cheese, divided
1 1/4 cups half and half, then a little more if needed
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 Tbsp minced parsley, for garnish (optional)

Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Scoop seeds and stringy center portion of from squash and discard or reserve seeds for another use.
Place squash cut side up on baking sheet. Brush flesh with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Turn upside down.
Bake in preheated oven until tender, about 40 minutes.
Let cool slightly or use and oven mitt to hold squash, and shred spaghetti squash with a fork while leaving about 1/4-inch border. Set strings aside and return unfilled boats to baking sheet.
In a large saute pan melt butter over medium heat. Add garlic and flour and saute 1 minute.
While whisking vigorously slowly pour in half and half. Let cook, stirring constantly, until just thickened.
Reduce heat to low, add parmesan and stir until melted. If mixture seems too thick add in a splash or two of half and half. Season mixture with salt and pepper to taste.
Remove from heat. Add shredded spaghetti squash and 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese and toss to evenly coat (taste again for salt).
Divide mixture evenly among squash halves. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese*.
Return to oven and bake until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes.
Sprinkle with parsley and serve warm.
