Thai Coconut Grilled Chicken

Ingredients
1/2 cup canned coconut milk (briefly warmed and stirred if lumpy)
1/4 cup lime juice, plus 2 tsp lime zest
1 - 2 Tbsp sambal oelek, to taste for desired heat
1 1/2 Tbsp brown sugar
1 Tbsp vegetable oil or olive oil
1 tsp ground coriander
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/8 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 Tbsp minced fresh ginger
1 1/2 Tbsp minced fresh garlic
Salt
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
6 boneless skinless chicken thighs,* trimmed of excess fat (about 2 lbs)

Instructions
In a medium mixing bowl whisk together coconut milk, lime juice and zest, sambal oelek, brown sugar, vegetable oil, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, garlic and season with salt to taste (I use about 1 to 1 1/2 tsp).
Place chicken thighs in a gallon size resealable bag. Measure out 1/3 cup of the marinade mixture (leaving plenty of the garlic and ginger behind), and reserve separately in the refrigerator for later use.
Pour remaining marinade over chicken in bag. Seal bag while pressing out excess air.
Transfer to fridge and let rest 1 - 6 hours.
Preheat a gas grill over medium-high heat, to about 400 degrees (clean grill grates).
Place chicken on grill and cook 5 - 6 minutes, then baste chicken with reserved 1/3 cup marinade mixture. Cook on opposite side until chicken registers 165 degrees in center of thickest portion, about 5 minutes longer.
Serve warm garnished with cilantro.
