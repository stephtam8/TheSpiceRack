Marinated Grilled Teriyaki Chicken

Ingredients
1/2 cup low-sodium soy sauce*
1/3 cup mirin
3 Tbsp packed light brown sugar
2 Tbsp honey**
2 Tbsp rice vinegar
1 Tbsp minced garlic
1 Tbsp peeled and minced fresh ginger
1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil, or more to taste
2 1/2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts (7 medium, trim away fat)
3 Tbsp water
1 1/2 tsp cornstarch
Sliced green onions and sesame seeds, for serving (optional)

Instructions
In a medium mixing bowl whisk together soy sauce, mirin, brown sugar, honey, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger and sesame oil. Ladle out 1/2 cup marinade (I like to leave most of the garlic and ginger bits in the bowl), and reserve the 1/2 cup in container in refrigerator.
Place chicken in a gallon size resealable bag, pour remaining marinade over chicken. Seal bag while pressing out excess air, rub marinade over chicken (or marinate in a bowl).
Transfer to refrigerator and let marinade 1 - 8 hours.
Near the end of marinating preheat a grill over medium heat (about 375 degrees). Clean grill grates and brush lightly with oil.
Grill chicken about 5 - 7 minutes per side (time will vary based on thickness and breasts will cook faster than thighs), until center registers 165 degrees.
While chicken is grilling heat reserved 1/2 cup marinade mixed with 2 Tbsp water in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce to low and let simmer about 2 - 3 minutes.
Whisk together remaining 1 Tbsp water and the cornstarch in a small bowl until well combined, then whisk into sauce. Let cook about 30 seconds longer while stirring constantly. If needed you can season sauce with a little salt.
Brush sauce over grilled teriyaki chicken. Serve warm garnished with green onions and sesame seeds if desired.
