French Bread Pizza

Ingredients
1 (14 oz) loaf French bread (about 17-inches long, 4-inches wide*)
1/4 cup olive oil
1 cup (scant) pizza sauce, preferably homemade, or store-bought
1 3/4 cups (7 oz) shredded mozzarella cheese
1/4 cup finely shredded parmesan cheese
Desired toppings (see notes for ideas)

Instructions
Move oven rack up one level and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a rimmed 18 by 13-inch baking sheet with aluminum foil for easier clean up if desired.
Cut french bread in half evenly through the length, to create two long portions. Cut each portion in half (creating four pieces total) and place them on baking sheet.
Brush both sides with olive oil. Turn upright and bake in preheated oven 4 minutes.
Spread pizza sauce over each piece, sprinkle evenly with mozzarella and parmesan cheeses, then finish with desired toppings.
Bake in preheated oven until cheese is fully melted, about 10- 13 minutes. If you'd like it more browned then broil during the last 1 minute or so (keep a close eye on it!).
Serve warm.
