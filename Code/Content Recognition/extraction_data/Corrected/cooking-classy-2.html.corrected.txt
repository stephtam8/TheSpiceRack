Baked Pork Tenderloin Recipe

Ingredients
2 (1 lb each) pork tenderloins*,
1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp freshly ground black pepper (crack a bit larger in grinder if possible)
Salt
1 Tbsp light olive oil or vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth
1 1/2 tsp minced fresh garlic, (1 large clove)
2 tsp cornstarch mixed with 1 Tbsp low-sodium chicken broth

Instructions
Place a 12-inch cast iron pan in oven and preheat oven to 450 degrees. This should take about 15- 20 minutes of pan resting in oven.
Meanwhile in a mixing bowl whisk together paprika, cumin, coriander, chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper and season with salt as desired.
Rub seasoning all over pork tenderloins to even cover.
Once oven is preheated remove pan from oven, immediately add oil and swirl in pan (don't forget pan is hot! Use oven mitts/or thick kitchen towels to handle pan). Right away place pork tenderloins in pan.
Return pan to oven and let roast 10 minutes. Remove from oven and turn tenderloins to opposite side.
Insert an oven meat thermometer in tenderloin (if you have one, otherwise you can just remove roast occasionally to check temperature) and continue to roast until pork registers 145 degrees in thickest portion of each, about 8 - 14 minutes longer.
Remove from oven and transfer roast to a carving board. Tent with foil and let rest 5 - 10 minutes.
Meanwhile place pan on stovetop over medium heat. Add garlic and saute about 20 seconds. Pour in chicken broth and let cook until sauce is reduced by about half, about 4 - 5 minutes.
Whisk in cornstarch chicken broth mixture and let cook until thickened, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper if needed.
Carve tenderloin into 1/2-inch thick slices and serve with pan sauce.
