Baked Parmesan Crusted Salmon

Ingredients
4 (6- 7 oz each) skinless salmon fillets
3/4 cup panko bread crumbs
3/4 cup finely shredded parmesan
2 1/2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley
3/4 tsp garlic powder
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 large egg
4 lemon slices

Instructions
Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Spray an oven safe wire cooling rack with non-stick cooking spray and set over a rimmed 18 by 13-inch baking sheet.
In a shallow dish toss together panko, parmesan, parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper (I use about 3/4 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper). Drizzle in olive oil and toss well to evenly coat mixture.
In a separate shallow dish beat the egg until yolk and white are well blended.
Working with one piece of salmon at a time dredge each side in egg, then transfer to panko mixture and coat and press both sides of salmon in panko mixture (also sprinkle panko mixture over top and press to help stick).
Transfer to prepared wire rack on baking sheet. Repeat process with remaining 3 portions (If you have extra breading sprinkle over fillets and gently press down to and even layer so they brown evenly).
Bake in preheated oven until salmon is barely cooked through, about 10 - 15 minutes (bake time will vary based on thickness of salmon).
Serve with lemon slices for spritzing over.
