Roast Turkey Breast

Ingredients
6 lb. bone-in skin-on turkey breast, fresh or frozen and fully thawed*
1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 Tbsp minced garlic (3 cloves)
1 Tbsp minced fresh thyme
1 Tbsp minced fresh rosemary
1 Tbsp minced fresh sage or parsley
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 large yellow onion, peeled and cut into chunks
1 large carrot, peeled and cut into chunks
2 celery ribs, cut into chunks
1/3 cup purpose flour
3 cups low-sodium chicken broth, preferably homemade, plus more to thin as desired

Instructions
Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Move oven rack one level below center.
Carefully separate skin from breast using a large spoon or the handle of a wooden spoon, while leaving outer edges if skin intact (so butter doesn't just seep out).
In a mixing bowl stir together butter, garlic, thyme, rosemary, sage and season with some salt and pepper.
Dab chicken dry with paper towels. Rub about half of the butter mixture all over underneath the skin then remaining half over.
Season all over with salt and pepper.
Add onion, carrot and celery to a medium roasting pan. Place a roasting rack over veggies if you have one (otherwise you can just place turkey directly over vegetables).
Place turkey skin side up on rack. Roast in preheated oven until center or thickest portion registers 165 on an instant read thermometer, about 2 to 2 1/4 hours.
Let turkey rest on a carving board tented with foil for about 10 minutes before carving.
For the gravy, discard veggies then pour drippings into a fat separator or liquid measuring cup. Measure out 1/3 cup of the fat drippings.
Heat fat drippings in saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly 1 minute. While whisking pour in broth an any remaining turkey broth drippings.
Let cook, whisk constantly, until mixture thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste as needed, thin with more chicken broth as desired.
