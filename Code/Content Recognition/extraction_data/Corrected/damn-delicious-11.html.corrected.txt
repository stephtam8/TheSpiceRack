HOMEMADE GNOCCHI

INGREDIENTS:
2 medium russet potatoes
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup whole milk ricotta
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
1 large egg
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Pierce potatoes with a fork; place potatoes onto the prepared baking sheet. Place into oven and bake until tender, about 1 hour. Let cool completely.
Cut in half; scoop flesh into a medium bowl and mash. Transfer 1 1/2 cups to a large bowl; stir in flour, ricotta, Parmesan, egg, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
Working on a lightly floured surface, divide dough into 6 equal pieces. Roll each piece into an 18-inch long rope, about 1-inch in diameter, sprinkling with additional flour as needed to prevent sticking. Using a sharp knife, cut each rope into 3/4-inch bite-size pieces; transfer to baking sheet.*
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; working in 3 batches, cook gnocchi until tender, stirring occasionally, about 4-6 minutes. Drain well and transfer to clean rimmed baking sheet.
