INSTANT POT CHICKEN ALFREDO

INGREDIENTS:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch chunks
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon unsalted butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup dry white wine
2 cups chicken stock
1 cup heavy cream
8 ounces fettuccini noodles, broken in half
3 ounces freshly grated Parmesan
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

DIRECTIONS:
Season chicken with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
Set a 6-qt Instant Pot® to the high saute setting. Melt butter; add chicken, and cook, stirring often, until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute; set aside chicken.
Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
Stir in chicken stock, heavy cream and pasta; top with chicken. Select manual setting; adjust pressure to high, and set time for 6 minutes. When finished cooking, quick-release pressure according to manufacturer’s directions.
Stir pasta; let mixture stand, stirring occasionally, until half the liquid has reduced, about 3 minutes.
Stir in Parmesan until melted, about 1 minute; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.
