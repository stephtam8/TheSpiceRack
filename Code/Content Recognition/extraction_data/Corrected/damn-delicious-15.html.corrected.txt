SHEET PAN LEMON ROSEMARY CHICKEN

INGREDIENTS:
8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 1/2 pounds pee wee potatoes (about 1/2 inch size)
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
1 lemon, sliced
1 bunch kale, stems removed and leaves torn into bite-sized pieces

DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.
Season chicken thighs with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Working in batches, add chicken, skin-side down, and sear both sides until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side.
Place chicken in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet.
In a large bowl, combine potatoes, garlic, thyme, rosemary, lemon and 2 tablespoons olive oil; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Place potato mixture in a single layer around the chicken on the prepared baking sheet.
Place into oven and roast until the chicken is almost cooked through and the potatoes are almost tender, about 25-30 minutes.
In a large bowl, massage kale with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Remove sheet pan from oven; stir potatoes and add kale. Place into oven and continue to roast for an additional 10-12 minutes, or until the kale has crisped. Let stand 5 minutes.
Serve immediately.
