QUICK TOMATO SAUCE

INGREDIENTS:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 pound lean ground beef
1 small onion, diced
1 celery rib, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 cup tomato paste
1/4 cup dry red wine
1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 (14.5-ounce) can fire roasted petite diced tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

DIRECTIONS:
Heat olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add ground beef, onion and celery, and cook until beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat.
Stir in garlic, oregano and basil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste.
Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
Stir in tomatoes and sugar. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended, about 10-15 minutes.*
Remove from heat; stir in Parmesan and butter until melted, about 1 minute; season with salt and pepper to taste.
Serve with desired pasta.
