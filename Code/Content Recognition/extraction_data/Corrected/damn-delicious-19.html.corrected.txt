BEST EVER BEEF STEW

INGREDIENTS:
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 pounds top sirloin steak, diced
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 medium sweet onion, diced
2 large carrots, peeled and diced
2 celery ribs, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 ounces cremini mushrooms, halved
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons tomato paste
1/2 cup dry red wine
2 1/2 cups beef stock
4 sprigs fresh thyme
2 bay leaves
1 large russet potato, peeled and cut in 1/2-inch chunks
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

DIRECTIONS:
Heat olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Season steak with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Working in batches, add steak to the stockpot and cook, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 6-8 minutes; set aside.
Add onion, carrots and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes.
Add garlic and mushrooms, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and browned, about 3-4 minutes.
Whisk in flour and tomato paste until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the stockpot.
Stir in beef stock, thyme, bay leaves and steak. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until beef is very tender, about 30 minutes.
Stir in potato; simmer until potatoes are just tender and stew has thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove and discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Stir in parsley; season with salt and pepper, to taste.*
Serve immediately.
