CREAMY CHICKEN AND GNOCCHI

INGREDIENTS:
1 (16-ounce) package cauliflower potato gnocchi
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
1 medium shallot, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 1/4 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup dry white wine*
1/2 cup half and half
1 bunch kale, stems removed and leaves torn into bite-sized pieces
1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, about 2 ounces

DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook gnocchi according to package instructions; drain well.
Season chicken with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown and cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side; set aside.
Melt remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Add shallot, and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
Gradually whisk in chicken broth and wine, and cook, whisking constantly, until slightly thickened, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in half and half until thickened, about 1-2 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Stir in gnocchi and kale until the kale has wilted, about 1-2 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet; sprinke with Parmesan.
Place into oven and bake until bubbly, about 10-12 minutes.
Serve immediately.
