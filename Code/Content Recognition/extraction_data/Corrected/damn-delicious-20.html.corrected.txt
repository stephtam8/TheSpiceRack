DIRECTIONS:
Add beef broth to a 6-qt Instant Pot®; whisk in cornstarch.
Stir in garlic, onion and green chiles. Gently place frozen ground beef on top; slightly overlapping.
In a small bowl, combine chili powder, paprika, oregano, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; sprinkle over frozen ground beef.
Select manual setting; adjust pressure to high, and set time for 20 minutes. When finished cooking, quick-release pressure according to manufacturer’s directions.
