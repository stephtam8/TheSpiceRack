MEATBALL BAKED ZITI

INGREDIENTS:
1 pound ziti pasta
3/4 pound ground beef
3/4 pound ground pork
1/3 cup Panko
2 large egg yolks
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/3 cup dry red wine
1 (32-ounce) jar marinara sauce
3 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
8 ounces burrata cheese, torn into large pieces

DIRECTIONS:
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9 x 13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray. 
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions for al dente; drain well.
In a large bowl, combine ground beef, ground pork, Panko, egg yolks, garlic, basil and oregano; season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Using a wooden spoon or clean hands, stir until well combined. Roll the mixture into 1-to-1-1/4-inch meatballs, forming about 24 meatballs.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add meatballs, in batches, and cook until all sides are browned, about 2-3 minutes. Return meatballs to the skillet.
Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
Stir in marinara sauce. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in pasta, basil and parsley.
Spread pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish; top with burrata.
Place into oven and bake until bubbly, about 25-30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes.
Serve immediately.
