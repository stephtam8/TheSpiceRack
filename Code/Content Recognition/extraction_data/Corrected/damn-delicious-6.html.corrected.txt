VODKA SAUCE

INGREDIENTS:
8 ounces radiatore pasta
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 medium shallots, diced
1/4 cup tomato paste
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more, to taste
1/4 cup vodka
1 (14.5 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1/4 cup basil leaves, chiffonade

DIRECTIONS:
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package instructions; reserve 1 cup water and drain well.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add garlic and shallots, and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 4-5 minutes.
Stir in tomato paste and red pepper flakes until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Working carefully, stir in vodka, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.
Stir in crush tomatoes and sugar. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced and thickened, about 10 minutes.
Stir in heavy cream and Parmesan until smooth, about 2 minutes.
Stir in pasta, adding reserved pasta water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Serve immediately, garnished with basil, if desired.
