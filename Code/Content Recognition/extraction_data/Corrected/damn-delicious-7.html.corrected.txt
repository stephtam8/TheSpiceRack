ONE POT CHICKEN AND MUSHROOM ORZO

INGREDIENTS:
1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
8 ounces cremini mushrooms, halved
2 large shallots, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
4 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
3 cups chicken stock
1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
1 cup orzo pasta
3-4 cups baby spinach
1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan
1/4 cup heavy cream
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

DIRECTIONS:
Season chicken with 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
Working in batches, add chicken to the skillet in a single layer and cook until golden brown and cooked through, reaching an internal temperature of 165 degrees F, about 4-5 minutes per side; set aside.
Add mushrooms and shallot, and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in garlic and thyme until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
Stir in chicken stock and Dijon, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir in orzo; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked through, about 6 minutes. Stir in spinach, Parmesan and heavy cream until the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet.
Serve immediately, garnished with parsley.
