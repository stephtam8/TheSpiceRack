INSTANT POT BBQ PULLED PORK

INGREDIENTS:
3 tablespoons brown sugar
4 teaspoons kosher salt
1 tablespoons paprika
2 teaspoons chili powder
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 (4-pound) boneless pork shoulder, excess fat trimmed and cut into 3-inch chunks
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 cup chicken stock
6 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, divided
1 (18-ounce) bottle favorite bbq sauce (we love Stubb’s)

DIRECTIONS:
Set a 6-qt Instant Pot® to the high saute setting.
In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, salt, paprika, chili powder, oregano, garlic powder, mustard, cayenne pepper, cumin and pepper. Season pork with brown sugar mixture.
Heat canola oil; working in two batches, add pork and cook until evenly browned, about 3-4 minutes.
Stir in chicken stock and 4 tablespoons vinegar, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Select manual setting; adjust pressure to high, and set time for 40 minutes. When finished cooking, quick-release pressure according to manufacturer’s directions.
Remove pork shoulder from the Instant Pot® and shred the meat using two forks; stir in remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar and season with salt and pepper, to taste, if needed.
Serve immediately with your favorite bbq sauce.
