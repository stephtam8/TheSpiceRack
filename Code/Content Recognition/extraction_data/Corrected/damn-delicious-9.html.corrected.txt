INSTANT POT MISSISSIPPI POT ROAST

INGREDIENTS:
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 (4 to 4 1/2 pound) boneless chuck roast, excess fat trimmed and cut into 6 pieces
1 cup beef stock
1 (1-ounce) package dry onion soup mix
6-8 jarred pepperoncini salad peppers, plus 1/4 cup liquid from jar
2 tablespoons dried parsley flakes
1 tablespoon dried chives
2 teaspoons dried dill
1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons cornstarch

DIRECTIONS:
Set a 6-qt Instant Pot® to the high saute setting. Heat oil; add beef and cook until evenly browned, about 2-3 minutes per side; set aside.
Stir in beef stock, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
Stir in dry onion soup mix, pepperoncini salad peppers and liquid, parsley flakes, chives, dill, onion powder, garlic powder and pepper. Return beef to the pot.
Select manual setting; adjust pressure to high, and set time for 45 minutes. When finished cooking, naturally release pressure according to manufacturer’s directions, about 20-30 minutes.
Remove beef from the Instant Pot®; shred, using two forks.
In a small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and 3 tablespoons cold water; set aside.
Select high sauté setting. Bring to a boil; stir in cornstarch mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until slightly thickened, about 3-5 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, add more beef stock as needed until desired consistency is reached.
Serve beef with juices immediately.
