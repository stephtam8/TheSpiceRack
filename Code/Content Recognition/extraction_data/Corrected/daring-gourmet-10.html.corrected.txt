Hard Sauce (Brandy Butter)

INGREDIENTS
1/2 cup (110 grams) unsalted butter , softened but not liquid
1 1/2 cups (180 grams) powdered sugar (aka confectioner's sugar)
2 tablespoons brandy (can substitute rum, cognac, sherry, whiskey), **non-alcoholic version: use 1 teaspoon imitation rum extract or simply omit it for a vanilla-infused hard sauce)
1/2 teaspoon quality pure vanilla extract (optional but we like to include it)

INSTRUCTIONS
Place the softened butter in a medium mixing bowl and beat for several minutes until pale and fluffy.
Add the sugar and continue to beat until smooth.  Avoid over-beating otherwise the brandy butter will become oily.
Add the brandy one tablespoon at a time, beating between additions, along with the vanilla.  Beat just until combined.
Cover and refrigerate the hard sauce for at least two hours before serving, preferably overnight or maximum flavor.  Remove it from the fridge at least a couple of hours before serving so it can come to room temp.  The texture should be soft and spreadable.  To store it keep it in the fridge where it will last for several months.
Makes a little over 1 cup or about 10 servings.
To serve spread it or place a dollop on hot desserts such as steamed pudding (including our traditional Christmas pudding), mincemeat pie, bread pudding, fruitcake, gingerbread, cobblers, crisps, and pies.
