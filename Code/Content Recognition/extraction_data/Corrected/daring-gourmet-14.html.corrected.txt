Eggnog Custard Sauce

INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour (Alternatively, can thicken at the end with cornstarch instead: Dissolve cornstarch in a little milk or eggnog and stir into the custard at the end and simmer until thickened)
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup sugar
2 cups quality eggnog
1 cup whole milk
3 large egg yolks , lightly beaten
1 teaspoon quality pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon quality pure rum extract

INSTRUCTIONS
Place the flour, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan and whisk in the eggnog and milk. Bring to a simmer, whisking frequently, until the mixture just starts to simmer. Remove 1/2 cup of the hot mixture and whisk it into the bowl of egg yolks until smooth. Pour the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the sauce, whisking constantly until combined. Return the sauce to a simmer, reduce to medium-low heat and continue whisking for a couple of minutes until the sauce is thickened. (If using cornstarch instead of flour you will add the slurry here at the end and simmer until thickened.)
If you prefer your custard smoother and runnier, add a little more eggnog or milk.
Pour the custard through a fine sieve into a bowl and discard any clumps.
If not serving immediately, cover with plastic wrap once cooled, pressing the plastic directly on top of the sauce so it's touching to prevent a film from developing on top of the sauce.
