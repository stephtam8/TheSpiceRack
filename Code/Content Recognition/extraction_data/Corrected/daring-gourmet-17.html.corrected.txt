Italian Wedding Soup

INGREDIENTS
1 pound ground meat beef, pork, chicken or turkey or a combination of them combined with some sausage
1/4 cup plain breadcrumbs preferably fresh
1 large egg
1 clove garlic finely minced
1/4 cup parsley finely chopped
1/4 cup grated Parmesan
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 small yellow onion finely chopped
1 clove garlic minced
8 cups Aneto 100% Natural Chicken Broth or homemade (quality broth makes all the difference
1 cup acini di pepe or other tiny pasta
1 large bunch leafy greens roughly chopped (e.g., kale, escarole, curly endive, spinach)
Freshly grated Parmesan for serving
Red pepper flakes for serving optional

INSTRUCTIONS
Place all of the meatball ingredients in a bowl or food processor and knead with your hands or pulse with the food processor until thoroughly combined. Form the mixture into tiny meatballs, about 1/2 inch in diameter and place them on a platter or cookie sheet. Wrap them with plastic wrap and refrigerate them until ready to use.
In a medium stock pot, heat the oil and cook the onions and garlic until translucent, 4-5 minutes. Add the chicken stock and bring it to a boil. Gently drop the meatballs into the soup followed by the pasta. Let the meatballs and pasta simmer for about 10 minutes. Add the leafy greens and simmer for 3-4 minutes or until wilted. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Dish up the soup and serve sprinkled with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and some red pepper flakes for a bit of heat.
Optional (a tradition in some circles): At very end, once the greens are wilted, whisk 1 tablespoon of grated parmesan cheese together with 1 large egg. Stir the broth to get it moving and gradually drizzle the egg mixture into the broth, stirring it gently with a fork to form thin stands of egg.
