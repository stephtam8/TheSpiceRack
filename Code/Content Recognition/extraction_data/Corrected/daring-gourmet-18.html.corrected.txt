Roasted Pumpkin Hummus

INGREDIENTS
1 pound diced fresh pumpkin , peel removed
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 head garlic , the pointy end cut off by about 1/4 inch to expose the cloves
15 ounce can garbanzo beans , drained (reserve some liquid) and drained
2-3 tablespoons homemade tahini (click link for recipe, it's super EASY and much CHEAPER!)
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup for just a touch of flavor (note: artificial maple syrup will simply make the hummus sweeter without adding much maple flavor)
4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
juice of one lemon
1 teaspoon salt
toasted pumpkin seeds, olive oil and a light sprinkle of cinnamon for serving olive oil and a sprinkle of cinnamon for serving

INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
In a bowl, toss together the pumpkin, oil and cumin. Spread the pieces out on a lined cookie sheet and add the head of garlic. Roast for 25-30 minutes or until the edges of the pumpkin and garlic have become a little blackened.
Place the pumpkin, garlic and garbanzo beans in a food processor along with the tahini, olive oil, maple syrup, lemon and salt. Blend until smooth, adding more olive oil as necessary. Add more tahini, maple syrup and salt to taste. If you want it creamier add some of the reserved garbanzo bean liquid and process until incorporated.
Scoop into a serving bowl drizzled with some olive oil and sprinkled with some pumpkin seeds and a touch of cinnamon.
Serve with chips, crackers or toasted pita bread.
