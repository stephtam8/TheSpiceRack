Traditional British Flapjacks

INGREDIENTS
1/2 stick (57 g) unsalted butter
3/4 cup (165 g) demerara sugar (highly recommend for its larger crystals that add crunch to the texture, but can substitute turbinado sugar instead. In a pinch you can use light brown sugar.)
1/2 cup (150 g) golden syrup
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 cups (400 g) quick cooking rolled oats (NOT instant oats or old-fashioned rolled oats)

INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 325 F. *For best results we recommend turning the fan off if you have that option. 
In a saucepan heat the butter, sugar, salt and golden syrup until the butter is melted and the sugar is mostly but not entirely dissolved. (The demerara sugar crystals add a nice crunch to the finished flapjacks.)
Place the oats in a large mixing bowl and pour the hot sugar mixture onto the oats. Stir to thoroughly coat the oats.
Spread the oat mixture out onto a lined baking sheet according to desired thickness, forming it into a rectangle or square, and pat it down with a spatula or similar.
Bake for 30-40 minutes or until lightly browned.  The middle should be springy but not extremely soft.  Let cool 10 minutes then cut into rectangles (or desired shape) and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.
Note: Number of servings depends on what size you cut the flapjacks.
