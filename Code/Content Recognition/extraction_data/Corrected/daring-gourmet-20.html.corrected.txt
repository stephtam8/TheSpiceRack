Gourmet Marinated Olives

INGREDIENTS
1 1/2 pounds assorted olives (kalamata, black, green, Spanish, etc) drained, **rinse the darker colored olives so they don't discolor the other lighter colors
3/4 cup good quality extra virgin olive oil
1/2 preserved lemon , pulp removed and discarded then the rind rinsed and finely diced
homemade preserved lemons (click link for recipe)
4 cloves garlic , thinly sliced
2 teaspoons coriander seeds , lightly cracked
1 teaspoon fennel seeds , lightly cracked
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary
1 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme
3 bay leaves , broken into pieces
1 dried red chili , membrane and seeds removed, broken into pieces

INSTRUCTIONS
Rinse the black olives so their juices don't discolor the other olives. Drain all the other olives in a colander, place them in a large bowl and set aside.
Heat a small dry pan over medium-high heat and, once hot, add the coriander and fennel seeds. Roast until very fragrant, about 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally. Be careful not to scorch them. Add the olive oil and heat for a minute. Remove from heat and add all remaining ingredients except for the olives. Let sit until the marinade has cooled down.
Pour the marinade over the olives and stir to combine. Cover the olives and let them sit in the fridge for a week or so for best flavor before eating them. Give them a shake every couple of days.
The olives will keep in the fridge for at least a month. Give them an occasional shake. Bring to room temperature before serving.
