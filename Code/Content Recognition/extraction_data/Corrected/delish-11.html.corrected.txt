INGREDIENTS
Cooking spray
2 c. chocolate graham cracker crumbs, finely crushed
2 tbsp. sugar
1/3 c. melted butter
1 (4-oz.) box BAKER’S White Chocolate, broken into pieces
4 candy canes, broken into pieces
1/2 c. JET-PUFFED Miniature Marshmallows
4 c. milk
1 (3.4-oz.) box JELL-O Vanilla Pudding Mix
1 (3.8-oz.) box JELL-O Chocolate Pudding Mix
1 (3.4-oz.) box JELL-O Vanilla Pudding Mix
2 c. COOL WHIP, thawed

DIRECTIONS
Make the crust: Preheat the oven to 375º. Grease a 9”-x-9” baking pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper. 
In a small bowl, mix together the cookie crumbs, sugar, and butter. Press well into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. 
Make the bark: Meanwhile, line a small sheet tray with parchment or wax paper. Melt chocolate in microwave on high for 20 second intervals until melted. Stir well and pour into the prepared pan. Using a small offset spatula, spread to about ⅛-inch thick, then top with candy canes and marshmallows. Refrigerate to chill and harden. 
Assemble the lasagna: In a medium bowl, whisk 1 box vanilla pudding mix with 1½ cups of milk for 2 minutes. Pour over crust spread into an even layer. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. 
Whisk chocolate pudding mix with 1 ½ cups of milk mixture for 2 minutes. Pour over the vanilla pudding layer and spread into an even layer, then refrigerate for another 10 minutes. Whisk remaining 1 cup of milk with the remaining box of pudding mix. Quickly fold in 2 cups COOL WHIP and spread evenly over the chocolate pudding layer. 
Break up bark and place the chunks all over the top of the lasagna. Refrigerate overnight before serving.
