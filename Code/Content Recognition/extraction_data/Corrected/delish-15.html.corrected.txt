Braised Pork Belly In Soy Sauce With Potatoes

INGREDIENTS
1 1/2 lb. pork belly, cut into 1 ½" cubes
1/2 Honeycrisp apple, peeled and cubed
1/3 c. low-sodium soy sauce
1 tbsp. dark mushroom soy sauce
1/4 c. mirin
2 c. water
1 ½" piece ginger, minced
4 large cloves garlic, halved
1/2 tsp. ground white pepper
1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
2 star anise
1 cinnamon stick
1 tsp. fennel seeds
1 tsp. crushed red rice yeast
1 lb. Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cubed

DIRECTIONS
In a large pot over medium heat, add pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a simmer, then drain immediately and gently rinse pork.
Return pot with pork to medium heat and add in all remaining ingredients except for potatoes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and let simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add potatoes, stir to combine, and continue simmering, covered, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are completely creamy, about 40 minutes more.
Remove lid and let sauce reduce and thicken until desired consistency, if necessary.
