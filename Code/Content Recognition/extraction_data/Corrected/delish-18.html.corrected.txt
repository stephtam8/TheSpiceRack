Multi-Seed Almond Sourdough Crackers

INGREDIENTS
1 1/3 c. almond flour (138 g.)
4 1/2 tbsp. cassava flour (38 g.)
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
1 tbsp. granulated sugar
1/4 tsp. kosher salt
3 tbsp. seeds of your choice (such as flax, sesame, and fennel seeds)
2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 c. sourdough starter discard (60 g.)

DIRECTIONS
In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, cassava flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and seeds. Stream in oil and mix together until flour mixture resembles sand. Add in starter and work in with your hands until evenly distributed and a cohesive dough forms when squeezed firmly. Transfer to an airtight container and let rest in the refrigerator until chilled, about 2 hours, up to overnight.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350Â°. Divide dough into four pieces and roll out between parchment or a floured work surface until 1/4" thick. Cut into desired shapes and transfer to a baking sheet, then lightly sprinkle with salt.
Bake until edges turn deeply golden, about 12 minutes.
Let cool 10 minutes before serving.
