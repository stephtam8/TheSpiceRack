Pão de Queijo (Brazilian Cheese Bread)

INGREDIENTS
1/3 c. heavy cream
2/3 c. water
2 tbsp. butter
2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1 tsp. black truffle salt 
10 oz. cassava flour (about 2 c.) 
2 large eggs
6 oz. grated cheese of your choice (about 2 c.)

DIRECTIONS
In a medium pot over medium heat, bring cream, water, butter, and oil to a simmer. In a large bowl, whisk together salt and flour. Slowly pour heated cream mixture over flour and stir until a loose dough forms.
Whisk in eggs one at a time until smooth. Fold in cheese until evenly combined. Transfer dough to the refrigerator and let chill for 2 hours.
When ready to bake, preheat oven to 400°. Line a baking sheet with parchment. With moistened hands, roll dough into balls, about 2 tablespoonfuls each. Place on prepared sheet tray at least 1" apart.
Bake until golden, 22 to 24 minutes.
