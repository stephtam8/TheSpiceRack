Pumpkin Spice Muddy Munch

INGREDIENTS
4 c. rice cereal squares
2 3/4 c. corn flakes or frosted flakes 
1 1/2 c. marshmallow fluff
2 tbsp. butter
3/4 c. good-quality white chocolate chips or chopped white chocolate
2 1/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice
2 tbsp. powdered sugar
 
DIRECTIONS
In a large bowl, mix together the cereals and set aside. 
Combine marshmallow fluff and butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave (on high) for 30 seconds, then stir to combine. Continue microwaving in 30 second increments until mixture is completely smooth. 
Combined chocolate and spices in separate microwave-safe bowl and heat in 30 increments until melted.  Stir together then fold into the marshmallow mixture until combined. 
Add this mixture to the cereal and toss gently until all cereal is coated. Spread mixture onto a parchment-coated sheet tray and sift the powdered sugar over it to coat. 
Let firm up on the counter or the refrigerator, break up into chunks, and place into individual snack-size bags before serving.
