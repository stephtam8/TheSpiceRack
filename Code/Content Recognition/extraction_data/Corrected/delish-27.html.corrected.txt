Sufganiyot

INGREDIENTS
1 3/4 c. all-purpose flour, divided
1/2 c. whole wheat flour
1 packet RapidRise yeast
1/4 c. honey
2 tsp. canola oil, plus more for frying 
2 large eggs  
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 tsp. kosher salt  
Butter for greasing
Peanut/canola oil for frying
1 13-oz. jar raspberry jam
Powdered sugar for dusting
 
DIRECTIONS
In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine 1 cup of all purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and yeast. In a small bowl, whisk ½ cup warm (not hot) water, honey, and canola oil, then add to the stand mixer. Mix on low until thoroughly combined, then add eggs, vanilla extract, and salt, and continue to mix for another 2 minutes.
While the mixer is running, slowly add the remaining ¾ cup of flour until a sticky dough forms. Transfer to a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes, adding more flour if necessary, until a more cohesive and less sticky dough is formed. Grease a large bowl with butter then add dough. Cover with a tea towel or plastic wrap and let proof for 1 hour.
Fill a large heavy bottomed pot with an 1½" oil and bring up to 365º over medium high heat. Return dough to floured surface and roll out dough into a large ¼"-thick rectangle. Using a cookie cutter or glass, cut as many 2" circles as you can. Cover them with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap while you fry.
Place a cooling rack over a rimmed sheet tray and set aside. Working in batches, add 4 donuts to hot oil. Fry for 1½ to 2 minutes, flipping halfway through, or until donuts are golden brown on each side with a light ring around the center. (Because these have whole wheat flour in them, they may be a bit darker!) Transfer to prepared cooling rack and repeat with remaining dough.
Fill a piping or plastic bag with raspberry jam and set aside. Once the sufganiyot have cooled completely, use a paring knife to open a slit in either the top or side of the doughnut. Fill each sufganiyot liberally with raspberry jam and dust with powdered sugar before serving.
