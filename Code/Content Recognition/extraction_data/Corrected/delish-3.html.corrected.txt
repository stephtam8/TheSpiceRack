Beef & Barley Soup

INGREDIENTS
2 lb. chuck roast beef, cut into 2-inch cubes
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
2 tbsp. all-purpose flour
4 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more as needed
8 oz. baby bella mushrooms, sliced
1 medium yellow onion, chopped
2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped
1 celery stalk, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp. dried oregano
1/2 tsp. onion powder
1 tbsp. tomato paste
1/2 c. dry red wine
4 c. low-sodium beef broth
2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
1/2 c. pearl barley
2 sprigs thyme

DIRECTIONS
Add beef to a large bowl and season well with salt and pepper. Add flour and toss until beef is coated on all sides. 
In a large pot over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Working in batches, add beef and cook until golden on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from pot and reserve on plate and repeat with remaining beef, adding more oil as necessary. 
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons of oil in pot. Add mushrooms, onion, carrot, and celery and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Add garlic, oregano, and onion powder and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Season with salt and pepper. Add tomato paste and stir until veggies are well coated and tomato paste has darkened. Add wine and scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Let simmer until reduced by about half, 5 minutes. 
Return beef to pot and add broth, Worcestershire sauce, barley, and thyme sprigs. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer, covered, until beef is tender and barley is cooked, about 40 minutes. Add water or more broth as needed to keep beef submerged. Season with salt and pepper. 
Remove thyme sprigs before serving.
