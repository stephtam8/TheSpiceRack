Tomato Rosemary Savory Mini Cheesecakes

INGREDIENTS
1 1/4 c. ROLD GOLD® Recipe No.™ 5 Savory Butter Artificially Flavored Pretzel Twists
1/4 c. unsalted butter
1 (16-oz.) block cream cheese, at room temperature
8 oz. goat cheese, at room temperature
2 tbsp. heavy cream
12 oz. small cherry or grape tomatoes
2 large sprigs rosemary, plus ½ tsp. Finely chopped fresh rosemary, plus 12 small sprigs, for garnish
1 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 tsp. lemon zest
1/4 tsp. garlic powder
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Balsamic vinegar glaze, for drizzling
 
DIRECTIONS
Line one 12-cup cupcake tin with paper liners.
In a food processor, add the pretzels and butter and pulse until fine crumbs form. Press pretzel mixture (about 1 tablespoon per liner) into bottom of paper liners.
Wipe out the food processor to remove any excess crumbs and add cream cheese, goat cheese, cream, chopped rosemary, lemon zest, and garlic powder. Pulse until smooth. Spoon the mixture on top of the crusts and smooth tops even with a spatula. Wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate until well chilled and set, at least 2 hours.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425°. Toss cherry tomatoes with large rosemary sprigs and oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Roast until tomatoes are blistered and beginning to burst, about 15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
Spoon roasted cherry tomatoes on top of cheesecakes. Drizzle each with balsamic vinegar and top with a small rosemary sprig.
