Classic English Muffins

INGREDIENTS
3 1/2 c. bread flour
2 tsp. granulated sugar
2 tsp. kosher salt
1 1/2 c. lukewarm milk
1 (0.25-oz.) envelope instant yeast
3 tbsp. butter, softened
1 large egg, beaten
Cooking spray
Coarse cornmeal
 
DIRECTIONS
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add flour, sugar, and salt. In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together milk and yeast. Add milk mixture, butter, and egg to dry ingredients. Mix on medium high speed until dough forms a ball and is shiny and elastic, 15 minutes. Dough will still be slightly sticky. 
Grease a large bowl with cooking spray and scrape dough into bowl. Cover and refrigerate overnight or at least 8 hours. 
Remove dough from fridge and let sit at room temp for 1 hour. 
Preheat oven to 350Â°. Line two large baking sheets with parchment and spread a thin layer of cornmeal on top. Lightly flour a work surface and divide dough into 15 equal pieces. Pinch seams together and using a cupped hand, roll each piece on counter to create a smooth ball and place on prepared baking sheets. Top each ball with a little cornmeal. Loosely cover and let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes. 
Heat a medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over low heat. Lightly press each ball down to flatten to 1" thick. Working in batches of 3 to 4 at a time, cook until bottom is golden, about 7 minutes. Flip and press dough down again. Cook another 5 to 7 minutes or until golden. Repeat with remaining dough. 
Place muffins back on a large baking sheet and bake until cooked through, 10 minutes. 
Use a fork to cut open muffins and serve warm.
