Best-Ever Baked Donuts

INGREDIENTS
2 c. all-purpose flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. kosher salt
1/4 tsp. baking soda
Pinch of nutmeg (optional)
2 large eggs
1/3 c. packed brown sugar
1/3 c. granulated sugar
3/4 c. milk, divided
1/2 c. sour cream
2 tbsp. melted butter
2 tbsp. vegetable oil
2 tsp. pure vanilla extract
1 c. semisweet chocolate chips

DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 400Â° and grease two donut pans. In a large bowl, whisk to combine flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and nutmeg if using.
In a medium bowl, whisk to combine eggs, sugars, 1/2 cup milk, sour cream, butter, vegetable oil, and vanilla until smooth. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and fold until just combined. (Some lumps are OK!)
Using a piping bag or resealable plastic bag, pipe batter into donut pan, filling each well about 3/4 of the way full.
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the tops appear dry and the undersides are golden. Let cool 5 minutes before turning out.
Meanwhile, combine chocolate chips and remaining 1/4 cup milk in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave at half power in 30-second increments, stirring after each round, until chocolate is completely melted.
Dip or spread donuts with frosting, then add sprinkles. Let chocolate set 10 minutes before serving.
