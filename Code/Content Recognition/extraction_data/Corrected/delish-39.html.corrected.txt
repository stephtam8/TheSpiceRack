Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes

INGREDIENTS
1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
3/4 tsp. kosher salt
1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
3/4 tsp. baking soda
1 tbsp. granulated sugar
2 1/4 c. buttermilk
1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract
4 tbsp. melted butter, plus more for serving
2 large eggs, beaten
2 c. fresh blueberries, plus more for serving
Maple syrup, for serving
 
DIRECTIONS
In a small bowl, mix flour, salt, baking powder and soda, and sugar together with a fork. In a large mixing bowl, combine buttermilk, vanilla, butter, and eggs until well-mixed. Fold in dry ingredients and blueberries until just incorporated. Do not over-mix (batter should be lumpy).
Heat griddle or large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add dab of butter and scoop 1/3 cup of batter on griddle. Cook for 2 minutes (bubbles will appear), then flip and cook 1 minute more. Pancakes should be golden brown. Repeat steps for remaining pancakes. 
Serve with butter, maple syrup, and blueberries.
