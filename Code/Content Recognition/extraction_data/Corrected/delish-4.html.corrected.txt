Bucatini all'Amatriciana

INGREDIENTS
1 lb. bucatini
6 oz. pancetta, cut into 1/2" pieces
1 small yellow onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes
1 (28-oz.) can crushed tomatoes
1 tbsp. butter
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper

DIRECTIONS
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package directions. Reserve ½ cup pasta water, then drain. 
In another large pot, over medium heat, cook pancetta until crisp, 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove pancetta from pot and reserve on a paper towel lined plate. Drain all but 2 tablespoon of grease from pot. Add onion to pot and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Add garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add crushed tomatoes and butter. Bring to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and more red pepper flakes as desired. 
Add in cooked pasta, ¼ cup reserved pasta water, and pancetta and toss to combine. Add more pasta water as needed to loosen and bind the sauce to the pasta. 
Serve topped with lots of Pecorino and fresh basil.
