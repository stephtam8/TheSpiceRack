Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread

INGREDIENTS
Cooking spray
2 c. all-purpose flour
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
1 tsp. baking soda
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. Kosher salt 
1/2 tsp. ground ginger
1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg
1/2 c. (1 stick) melted butter
1 1/4 c. granulated sugar
1 c. pumpkin puree
1/4 c. sour cream
2 large eggs
1 tsp. pure vanilla extract
1 1/4 c. mini chocolate chips
 
DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 350°. Line an 8“-x-4” loaf pan with parchment paper then grease with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cinnamon, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ginger, and nutmeg. 
In a separate large bowl using a hand mixer, beat melted butter, sugar, pumpkin puree, sour cream, eggs, and vanilla.
Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips, reserving 2 tablespoons for topping loaf, and transfer batter to prepared pan. Smooth top with an offset spatula and sprinkle with remaining chocolate chips.
Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes, covering the top with a foil tent after 1 hour if top appears to be getting too dark. 
Let cool 15 minutes before removing from pan and slicing.
