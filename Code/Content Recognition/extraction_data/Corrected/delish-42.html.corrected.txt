Best-Ever Blueberry Buckle

INGREDIENTS
1/2 c. all-purpose flour
1/3 c. granulated sugar
4 tbsp. melted butter
1 tsp. ground cinnamon
Pinch kosher salt
2 c. all-purpose flour
2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp. kosher salt
4 tbsp. butter, softened to room temperature
1/2 c. granulated sugar
1/4 c. packed brown sugar
1 large egg
2 tsp. pure vanilla extract
1 c. buttermilk
2 c. fresh blueberries
 
DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 375Â°, grease a 8" square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. 
Make crumble: In a medium bowl, stir to combine all crumble ingredients until no dry spots remain.
Make cake: In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. In a medium bowl, beat to combine butter, sugars, egg, and vanilla. Alternate adding buttermilk and dry ingredients until both are used. Gently fold in blueberries until just combined and transfer to prepared baking pan.
Add crumble mix to top of batter in an even layer. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. 
Let cool at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
