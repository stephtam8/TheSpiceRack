Mediterranean Grilled Chicken Salad

INGREDIENTS
2 boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds)
1 tsp. ground coriander
1 tsp. dried oregano
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
5 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
4 tbsp. red wine vinegar
1 tbsp. freshly chopped parsley
4 romaine hearts, chopped
3 Persian cucumbers, thinly sliced
1 c. grape or cherry tomatoes, halved
2 avocados, sliced
4 oz. feta, crumbled
1/2 c. pitted kalamata olives, halved

DIRECTIONS
Heat grill to medium-high. Season chicken with coriander, oregano, salt, and pepper. Grill, covered, turning halfway through, until golden and no longer pink, 18 to 22 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes, then slice.
Meanwhile, make dressing. Whisk olive oil, red wine vinegar, and parsley in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper.
Divide lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, feta, and olives among four serving bowls. Top with sliced chicken, then drizzle with dressing.
