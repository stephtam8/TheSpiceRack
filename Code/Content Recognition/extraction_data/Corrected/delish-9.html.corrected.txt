Loaded Peanut Butter Pretzel Sticks

INGREDIENTS
1/3 c. smooth peanut butter
2 tbsp. unsalted butter
1 (16-oz.) bag ROLD GOLD® Recipe No.™ 5 Savory Butter Artificially Flavored Pretzel Twists
1/2 c. dark chocolate chips
4 soft caramel, unwrapped
1 tsp. heavy cream
1/4 c. finely chopped honey roasted peanuts
1/4 c. mini chocolate chips

DIRECTIONS
In a medium microwave safe bowl, microwave the peanut butter and butter until just melted, about 30 seconds. Stir until smooth. Scrape the peanut butter mixture into a short thin glass. Dip 48 pretzels into peanut butter mixture, leaving a scant ½-inch at bottom for holding. 
Arrange the PB dipped pretzels on a parchment lined baking sheet and freeze until peanut butter is cold and solid, about 20 minutes. Reserve any remaining peanut butter mixture at room temperature.
In another medium, microwave safe bowl, microwave the dark chocolate chips until just melted, about 1 minute 30 seconds. Stir until smooth. Scrape the melted chocolate into a short thin glass. Coat the frozen peanut butter dipped portions of the pretzels in the melted chocolate. Return to the baking sheet. 
In a small microwave safe bowl, microwave the caramel and heavy cream until just melted, about 30 seconds. Stir until smooth. Using a spoon drizzle over top of coated pretzels. 
If necessary, remelt peanut butter mixture so it is a good consistency for drizzling, otherwise use right away. Using a spoon, drizzle the peanut butter mixture over top of coated pretzels.
Sprinkle coated tops of pretzels with peanuts and mini chocolate chips, pressing gently to adhere topping into pretzels, if necessary. Return baking sheet to freezer and freeze until set, about 20 minutes more. Enjoy or transfer to refrigerator and cover for up to 5 days. Serve chilled.
