One-Pan Chicken Drumsticks with Rice and Beans

INGREDIENTS
8 chicken drumsticks
2 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, divided
1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper
3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1 onion, finely chopped
1 tsp. ground cinnamon or cumin
1 tsp. ground turmeric, curry powder, or ground coriander
1/2 cup white rice (any type except for sticky rice)
1 (15-oz.) can chickpeas, white beans, black beans, or other beans, drained, rinsed
1/2 cup dried fruit, such as currants, raisins, cherries, or cranberries (optional)
1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
1/4 cup coarsely chopped tender herbs, such as cilantro, parsley, mint, basil, and/or dill

PREPARATION
Season drumsticks on all sides with 2 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. black pepper.
Heat oil in a large deep-sided skillet over medium-high. Add chicken and cook, turning once halfway through, until skin is golden brown, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to a plate.
Add onion, cinnamon, and turmeric to fat in skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add rice and stir to coat. Add 1 1/4 cups hot water, scraping up browned bits from pan, then stir in chickpeas, dried fruit (if using), red pepper (if using), and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt. Nestle chicken back into skillet and bring liquid to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, 20â€“25 minutes.
Remove from heat and let sit 5 minutes. Fluff rice with a fork, then scatter herbs over.
