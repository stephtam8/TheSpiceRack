Eggplant Omelet (Tortang Talong)

INGREDIENTS
2 large Asian eggplants (about 1/3 pound/155 g each)
2 extra-large eggs
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons picked cooked crabmeat (optional)
Fish sauce, for serving

PREPARATION
Preheat the broiler.
Lay the eggplants in a single layer on a baking sheet and broil them, flipping once or twice, until they are soft and blackened on all sides, about 15 minutes. (If you have a gas stove, you can do this by holding the eggplants with tongs over a burner on medium-high heat, turning them so they blacken on all sides.)
Place the softened eggplants in a ziplock bag. Set aside for 10 minutes to steam (this makes the skin easier to peel). Peel the eggplants, discarding the skins, and use a fork to gently flatten the flesh.
Put the eggs in a shallow bowl. Beat well and season with salt and pepper.
In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Dip each eggplant in the beaten eggs, letting it soak for a second or two so that it is well covered with the egg. Season the egg-dipped eggplant with additional salt and pepper and place it in the skillet. Repeat with the other eggplant, making sure there’s room between them in the skillet. Place 1 tablespoon of the crab (if using) on top of each eggplant, pressing it down with a fork.
When the eggplants are crispy and browned on one side, 4 to 5 minutes, flip them over and cook until browned and crispy on the second side, about 3 minutes more. Transfer the eggplants to a paper towel–lined plate to drain.
Serve hot or at room temperature, with fish sauce.
