Peach Cobbler

INGREDIENTS
10 large peaches (about 4½ pounds), unpeeled, cut into 1-inch chunks
Zest and juice of 1 large lemon
½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
2 cups sugar, divided
1½ cups (about 192 grams) all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon kosher salt
¾ cup whole milk
½ cup hot tap water
Heavy cream, for serving

PREPARATION
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
Put the peaches in a 9-by-13-inch (or similar) baking pan or gratin dish. Pat the peaches into a roughly even layer, then, using a zester or a Microplane, zest the lemon evenly over the fruit and squeeze the lemon juice evenly over the top.
In the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and 1½ cups of the sugar on medium speed until sandy, about 1 minute. Add the flour, baking powder, and salt, and beat again for another 30 seconds, until all the flour is incorporated and the mixture is evenly crumbly. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add in the milk. Increase the speed to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Plop the batter in 6 large blobs over the top of the peaches. With an offset spatula or small knife, carefully spread the batter evenly over the fruit, so it’s no more than about ½ inch thick in any one place.
Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup sugar directly over the batter. Drizzle the hot water evenly over the sugar, using it to melt the sugar into the topping. (Use it all. It’s a strange method, but it works.)
Bake the cobbler for 70 to 80 minutes, or until the top is browned and cracked. (A toothpick inserted into the topping should come out dry—be sure to check in a few places.)
Let the cobbler sit for about a half an hour to firm up before serving warm in big bowls, with heavy cream poured on top.
