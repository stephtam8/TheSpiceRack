Miso-Squash Ramen

INGREDIENTS
1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1 Tbsp. white miso
2 tsp. pure maple syrup or brown sugar
1 tsp. regular soy sauce or tamari
1 small kabocha squash (about 2 lb.), peeled, cut into 1"-thick wedges, or 1 small butternut squash (about 2 lb.), peeled, cut into 1" pieces
1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
1 (1") piece ginger, coarsely chopped
2 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped
4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
2 Tbsp. white miso
Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
1 large bunch broccolini (8–10 oz.), halved crosswise, thicker stalks halved lengthwise
4 (5-oz.) packages wavy ramen noodles, preferably fresh
Handful of cilantro leaves with tender stems

PREPARATION
Preheat oven to 400°F. Whisk oil, miso, maple syrup, and soy sauce in a small bowl until a thick paste forms. Place squash on a rimmed baking sheet and scrape dressing over; toss to coat. Arrange squash in a single layer and roast until fork-tender (it will be a little caramelized in spots), 25–30 minutes.
Heat oil in a medium pot over medium-high. Add ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, 1 minute. Add broth and bring to a boil. Remove from heat.
Set 8 roasted squash wedges (or about 2 cups if using butternut) aside for serving. Add miso and remaining squash to pot and blend with an immersion blender until mostly smooth; season with salt and pepper. (Alternatively, you can let broth cool slightly, then purée with sqush and miso in a regular blender.)
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil and cook broccolini until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Using tongs, transfer to a plate.
Add noodles to same pot and cook according to packet directions. Drain and divide noodles among bowls.
Ladle broth over noodles and arrange broccolini and reserved squash (cut in half if they are very big) on top. Scatter cilantro over.
