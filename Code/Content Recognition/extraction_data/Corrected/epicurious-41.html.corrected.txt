Crispy Salt and Pepper Potatoes

INGREDIENTS
2 large egg whites
1 pound new potatoes (about 1 inch in diameter)
2 teaspoons kosher salt
¾ teaspoon finely ground black pepper
1 teaspoon finely chopped rosemary
1 teaspoon finely chopped thyme
1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley

PREPARATION
Preheat oven to 400°F and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites until foamy (there shouldn’t be any liquid whites in the bowl). Add the potatoes and toss until they’re well coated with the egg whites, then transfer to a strainer or colander and let the excess whites drain. Season the potatoes with the salt, pepper, and herbs. Scatter the potatoes on the baking sheet (make sure they’re not touching) and roast until the potatoes are very crispy and tender when poked with a knife, about 20 minutes (depending on the size of the potatoes).
Transfer to a bowl and serve.
