Wafflemaker Hash Browns

Ingredients
Olive oil cooking spray, for spraying the waffle iron
One 30-ounce bag frozen shredded hash browns, thawed
4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) butter, melted 
1 teaspoon kosher salt 
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
3/4 cup grated Cheddar
3/4 cup chopped ham 

Directions
Preheat a waffle iron on the regular setting and spray both sides with cooking spray.
Squeeze out any excess moisture from the hash browns and put in a bowl. Pour the melted butter over the hash browns, sprinkle with the salt and pepper and stir. Scoop a heaping 1/2 cup of the seasoned hash browns into each waffle section, then top with a generous 2 tablespoons Cheddar followed by a sprinkling of chopped ham. Top the cheese and ham in each section with another 1/4 cup hash browns. Close the waffle iron and cook for 15 minutes on the regular setting.
Repeat with the remaining hash browns, cheese and ham, filling one section of the waffle iron.
