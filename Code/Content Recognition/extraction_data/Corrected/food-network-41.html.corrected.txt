The Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies

Ingredients
2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note)
1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt 
1 teaspoon baking powder 
1 teaspoon baking soda 
2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened 
1 3/4 cups packed dark brown sugar 
2 large eggs, at room temperature 
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste 
One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips (about 2 cups) 

Directions
Sift the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl.
Beat the butter and brown sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. (Use the paddle attachment for a stand mixer.) Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the dry ingredients and beat until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.  
Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the dough and refrigerate at least 1 hour or preferably overnight. 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  
Use a 1-ounce ice cream scoop to scoop half the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart. Chill the remaining dough while you bake the first batch. 
Bake at 375 degrees until the cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the middle, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Cool the baking sheets completely, then line with parchment paper and repeat the scooping and baking process with the remaining dough.
