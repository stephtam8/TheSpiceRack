RUSTIC POTATO LEEK SOUP

INGREDIENTS
2 tablespoons olive oil (or butter)
1 medium white onion, peeled and diced
3 leeks, sliced into 1/2-inch half moons (white and light green parts only)
1 rib celery, thinly sliced
5 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup dry white wine
1 1/4 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into bite-sized chunks
6 cups vegetable stock
4 sprigs fresh thyme
2 bay leaves
1/4 teaspoon cayenne (or less, if you prefer)
fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper
optional toppings: homemade croutons, grated Parmesan, chopped fresh chives

INSTRUCTIONS
Sauté the veggies. Heat olive oil (or butter) in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the leeks, celery and garlic and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.
Add the potatoes and broth. Add the white wine and use a wooden spoon to lift off any browned bits that are stuck to the bottom of the stockpot.  Add the potatoes, vegetable stock, thyme, bay leaves, cayenne and stir to combine.
Simmer. Continue cooking until the soup reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.
Season. Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme stems.  Give the soup a taste and season with however much salt and black pepper you think it needs.
Serve. Serve warm, garnished with whatever toppings sound good, and enjoy!
