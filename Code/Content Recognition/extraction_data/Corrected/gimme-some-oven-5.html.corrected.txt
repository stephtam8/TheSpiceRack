SWEET POTATO CHICKPEA COCONUT CURRY

INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large white or yellow onion, diced
1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger (or 1 teaspoon ground ginger)
4 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons curry powder
2 teaspoons garam masala
1 cup plain oat milk (or almond milk or veggie stock)
1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
1 (15-ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes (with their juices)
1 (13-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
1 large sweet potato (about 1 pound), peeled and diced into 1/2-inch cubes
2 large handfuls fresh baby spinach
juice of 1 fresh lemon
fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper
toppings: chopped fresh cilantro, thinly-sliced red onions and/or crushed red pepper flakes

INSTRUCTIONS
Sauté the veggies. Heat the oil in a large sauté pan or stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the onion and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened.  Add the ginger and garlic and sauté for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.  Add the curry powder and garam masala and sauté for 1 minute, stirring occasionally.
Add the next round of ingredients. Add the oat milk, chickpeas, tomatoes, coconut milk, sweet potato and stir to combine.  Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a very low simmer.
Simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking the curry (uncovered) over a very low simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sweet potatoes are softened, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Stir in the remaining ingredients. Add the baby spinach and lemon juice and gently toss with the curry until the spinach has begun to wilt.  Season the curry with however much salt and pepper you think is needed, to taste.
Serve. Serve warm, garnished with lots of toppings, with either naan, rice, and/or rice noodles.
