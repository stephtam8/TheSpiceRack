OATMEAL COOKIES

INGREDIENTS
1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats
3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt*
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
2/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
(optional) up to 1 cup total of add-ins, which could include a mix of anything from raisins to chocolate chips, chopped nuts, M&Ms, other fun baking chips or dried fruit and more

INSTRUCTIONS
Combine the dry ingredients. Combine the oats, flour, cinnamon, salt and baking soda in a medium mixing bowl and stir to combine.
Mix the wet ingredients. In a separate large mixing bowl, either with a stand mixer or a hand mixer, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally as needed. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat on medium speed until combined, about 30 seconds.
Add in the dry ingredients. Add the dry ingredient mixture and beat on low-speed until combined.
Stir in any (optional) add-ins. Sprinkle any add-ins evenly over the dough and stir by hand until they are evenly combined.
Chill the dough. Transfer the dough to a food storage container and refrigerate for at least 1-2 hours until chilled.  (Or see a faster chilling method below.)
Prep the cookies. Heat the oven to 350°F (180°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Use a medium cookie scoop to form the dough into 2-tablespoon balls and place them a few inches apart on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies are lightly golden around the edges and the centers are set.
Cool. Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack and let the cookies cool for 5 minutes.  (You can also sprinkle them with a pinch of flaky sea salt, if you’d like.)  Then serve warm and enjoy!
