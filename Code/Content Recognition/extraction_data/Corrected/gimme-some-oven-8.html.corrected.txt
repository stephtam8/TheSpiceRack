MAPLE CRANBERRY SAUCE

INGREDIENTS
1 (12-ounce) bag fresh or frozen cranberries, rinsed and picked over
1/3 cup maple syrup, or more to taste
1/3 cup water
juice and zest of one fresh orange (about 1/4 cup juice)

INSTRUCTIONS
Combine ingredients. Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan and stir to combine.
Simmer. Heat over medium-high heat until the mixture reaches a simmer.  Reduce heat and simmer for 8-10 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and reached your desired consistency.  (Keep in mind that it will also thicken a bit more as it cools.)
Season. Taste and add extra maple syrup, if needed.
Serve. You can either serve this cranberry sauce warm or let it cool in the refrigerator until chilled and then serve it cold.
