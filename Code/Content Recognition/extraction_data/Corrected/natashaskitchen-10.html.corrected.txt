Breakfast BLT Sandwich

Ingredients
8 slices of bread
12 oz bacon
4 eggs
1 avocado pitted and sliced
1 large tomato sliced or sliced baby tomatoes
4 green lettuce leaves
Mayo or your favorite sandwich spread
S&P

Instructions
Line a rimmed cookie sheet with foil. Line a rack with bacon and place the rack over the lined cookie sheet.
Bake at 400ËšF for 20 minutes. The rack allows for heat to circulate around the bacon, but I've made it without the rack and it was still great!
Saute your eggs over medium heat with 1/2 Tbsp olive oil. Lightly season with S&P. I left the yolk untouched and didn't flip them. I did put the lid on for 30 seconds in the end so the whites would be fully cooked. The yolk was still juicy.
Toast both sides of your bread until golden (we did this over a skillet with a little butter)
Spread mayo on one side of each bread slice.
One one half, add bacon, and egg. On the second half, add lettuce, avocados, tomatoes and sprinkle lightly with S&P. Sandwich the two halves together and skewer with a toothpick for effect ðŸ™‚ Seriously this sandwich is awesome.
