Juicy Roast Chicken Recipe

Ingredients
6 Yukon gold potatoes peeled and quartered (or 8 red potatoes)
2 large carrots peeled and cut into 1” pieces
1 medium onion chopped into 1” pieces
1 head of garlic cut in half parallel to the base, divided
4 sprigs rosemary divided
1 Tbsp olive oil
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
5 1/2 lb whole chicken giblets removed, patted dry
2 1/2 tsp salt divided (1/2 tsp for inside, 2 tsp for outside)
3/4 tsp pepper divided (1/4 for inside, 1/2 for outside)
2 Tbsp unsalted butter melted
1 lemon halved

Instructions
Place chopped potatoes, carrots, onion, half of a head of garlic, and 2 sprigs of rosemary in a mixing bowl. Drizzle with 1 Tbsp olive oil and season with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper.
Place chicken in a roasting pan. Remove giblets from chicken and pat dry inside and outside with paper towels. Season inside the chicken with 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Stuff the chicken with 1/2 of the garlic head, 2 lemon halves, and 2 sprigs of rosemary.
Melt 2 Tbsp of butter. Brush the chicken all over the top and sides with melted butter then season all over with 2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper.
Tie the legs together and tuck the wings under the bird. Spread veggies around the chicken. Roast in the oven uncovered at 425˚F for 80 to 90 minutes (depending on size of chicken*) until internal temperature of the thigh reaches 165˚F or until the juices run clear when you cut into the thigh.
Transfer chicken and veggies to a platter, tent with foil, and let rest at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.
