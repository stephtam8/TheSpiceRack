Baked Ziti (Easy Pasta Casserole)

Ingredients
1 lb ziti pasta or penne pasta
1 lb ground beef 85% lean
1 onion chopped
2 garlic cloves minced
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
5 cups marinara sauce
15 oz fresh ricotta
10 fresh basil leaves
12 oz mozzarella cheese shredded, divided
1 cup grated parmesan cheese divided

Instructions
Cook pasta in salted water according to package instructions until just aldente them drain (so not overcook since they will continue to cook in the oven).
In a deep pan or dutch oven, over medium-high heat, cook ground beef and onion, breaking up the beef with a spatula, until beef is fully cooked through and onions are softened (5-7 minutes). Add minced garlic, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper and sautee another minute. Add 5 cups marinara, bring to a simmer and continue cooking 5 minutes then turn off the heat.
Spread a ladle of meat sauce over the bottom of a 9x13 casserole dish.
Into the remaining sauce, add chopped basil and spoon in ricotta. Add cooked pasta and stir just until noodles are coated (you want to keep that ricotta texture)
Transfer half of the pasta to the casserole dish. Top with 1/2 of shredded mozzarella and 1/2 grated parmesan. Add remaining pasta and top with remaining mozzarella and parmesan.
Clear the edges of the pan so the cheese doesn’t burn onto the dish. Bake at 350˚F for 25 minutes. Broil 1-2 minutes to brown the cheese. Let cool 5 minutes then garnish with basil if desired and serve.
