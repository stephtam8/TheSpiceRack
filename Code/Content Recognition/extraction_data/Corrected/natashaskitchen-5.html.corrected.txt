Roasted Tomato Salsa

Ingredients
15-20 medium tomatoes
5-10 Serrano peppers or 5-10 jalapeño peppers
1 red or green bell pepper optional (we use it when we have one on hand)
2 medium yellow onions
1 head of garlic
1 bunch of cilantro
1 Tbsp salt
Don't forget the tortilla chips!

Instructions
Preheat oven to 375°F.
Cut tomatoes, onions and peppers in half. Scrape out the seeds from the peppers. Peel garlic. Lay vegetables cut-side up on two baking sheets, and roast for 25 minutes or until tomatoes and onions are soft.
After 25 min, move the rack to the highest position, set the oven to broil and roast vegetables for an additional 5 minutes. The tops of the serrano peppers should start to look charred (check on the veggies a couple times to make sure they don't turn too black). Remove the baking sheets from the oven being careful not to spill any of the tomato juices that have accumulated.
Let vegetables cool down a bit then use a food processor to blend everything together along with one bunch of cilantro, 1 Tbsp of salt and any tomato juice left in the baking dish (feel free to discard tomato juice for a thicker salsa. If your food processor is small, process in a few batches then mix it all together. Let cool to room temp, then cover and refrigerate until ready to eat.
