In a medium saucepan, combine vinegar, salt, sugar, garlic, bay leaves, ground black pepper, red pepper and dill. Simmer marinade for 5 minutes.
Add 2 cups water, bring to a boil and simmer another 5 minutes. Lastly, add oil and turn off the heat.
Boil 16 cups (4 quarts) Water with 3 Tbsp vinegar (or juice from 1 lemon) - to prevent browning of mushrooms.
