Sour Cream Blueberry Pancakes

Ingredients
1 cup milk room temp
3/4 cup sour cream
2 large eggs
4 Tbsp unsalted butter melted
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
2 cups all-purpose flour
3 Tbsp granulated sugar
2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
Oil or butter to saute
1 cup of blueberries + more for topping

Instructions
In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients (2 cups flour, 3 Tbsp sugar, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt).
In a separate large bowl, whisk together wet ingredients (1 cup milk, 3/4 cup sour cream, 2 large eggs, 4 Tbsp melted butter, 1/2 tsp vanilla). Pour dry ingredients over wet ingredients and fold everything together just until smooth and no streaks or large clumps of flour remain then fold in blueberries until dispursed.
Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat and add butter or oil. Once it's hot, you can use either an ice cream scoop or spoon to add the batter to the pan. Saute 2 minutes per side or until golden brown on each side and fluffy. If they brown too quickly, reduce the heat to allow a full 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving platter when done and serve warm with desired toppings.
