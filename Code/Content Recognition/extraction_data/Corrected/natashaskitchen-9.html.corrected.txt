Quick and Easy Buttermilk Pancakes

Ingredients
2 cups + 2 Tbsp All Purpose Flour
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp baking powder
1 Tbsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
3 eggs
2 cups buttermilk
1 Tbsp melted butter
Oil to saut√© (we used extra light olive oil)

Instructions
In a large mixing bowl whisk together the dry ingredients: 2 cups + 2 Tbsp flour, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 Tbsp of sugar and 1/4 tsp of salt.
In a separate medium mixing bowl whisk together wet ingredients: 3 eggs, 2 cups buttermilk and 1 Tbsp melted butter.
Heat a large heavy-bottomed skillet over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil (we used extra light olive oil).
Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and whisk everything together by hand until well combined.
Add a heaping Tablespoon of batter to the preheated skillet and saute about 4-5 of them at a time for a 2 minutes per side. Don't crowd the pan or you will have 1 giant pancake, unless that's what you're going for.
Remove finished pancakes from the skillet and serve warm. Repeat the process with the rest of the batter. Serve warm.
