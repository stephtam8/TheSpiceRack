Hot and Sour Dumpling Soup

INGREDIENTS
3  tablespoons safflower or canola oil
8  ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and thinly sliced (about 3 cups)
2  tablespoons minced fresh ginger
 Kosher salt and pepper
8  cups low-sodium chicken broth
6  ounces firm tofu, cut into matchsticks (1 cup)
⅓  cup low-sodium soy sauce
2  ounces drained canned, sliced bamboo shoots, cut into matchsticks (1/3 cup)
¼  teaspoon ground white pepper (optional), plus more to taste
12  frozen pork gyoza or potsticker dumplings (about 8 ounces)
¼  cup cornstarch
3  tablespoons distilled white vinegar
 Thinly sliced scallions and fresh chiles (such as red Fresno or jalapeño), for garnish

PREPARATION
In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium. Add mushrooms and ginger and season with salt and pepper. Cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Stir in broth, tofu, soy sauce, bamboo shoots and white pepper, if using, and bring to a boil over high. Add dumplings and simmer over medium heat until dumplings are cooked through, about 5 minutes.
In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch with 1/4 cup water to form a slurry. Add slurry and vinegar to saucepan and simmer until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and more white pepper, if desired.
Divide soup among bowls and garnish with scallions and chiles. Serve hot.
