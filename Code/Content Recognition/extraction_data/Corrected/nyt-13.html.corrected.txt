Leeks With Anchovy Butter

INGREDIENTS
 Salt
6  thin leeks, trimmed, halved lengthwise and washed
4  tablespoons butter, softened
4  anchovy fillets, drained
1  tablespoon chopped parsley
1  teaspoon chopped basil
1  tablespoon chopped shallot
1  teaspoon lemon juice, plus more to taste
 Freshly ground black pepper

PREPARATION
Using cooking twine, tie the leeks into two bunches. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the leeks and cook until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drop into ice water to stop the cooking. Drain, then press out excess water on a towel. Set cut-side up in a large baking dish.
Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place the butter, anchovies, parsley, basil, shallot and lemon juice in a large bowl. Mash with a fork or potato masher until well blended and the anchovies have dissolved into a paste. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Spread the butter mixture over the cut sides of the leeks. Bake for 5 minutes or until warmed through. Squeeze over more lemon juice, if you like.
