Rice Cake Soup With Bok Choy and Edamame

INGREDIENTS
Â¼  cup vegetable oil
2  medium leeks, trimmed, white and light green parts cut into 1/4-inch rounds
1  bunch scallions (about 6), whites and greens separated, thinly sliced
1  (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced
 Kosher salt and black pepper
4  cups chicken stock
2  medium heads baby bok choy (about 8 ounces), trimmed, stems and leaves divided, stems cut into bite-size pieces
2  cups fresh or frozen rice cakes (about 10 ounces)
1  cup frozen shelled edamame
2  large eggs, lightly beaten
1  tablespoon apple cider vinegar

PREPARATION
In a pot, heat oil over medium-high. Add leeks, scallion whites and ginger, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden at the edges and softened, 7 to 8 minutes.
Add chicken stock and bok choy stems, and bring to a boil over high. Reduce the heat and simmer and cook until the broth is flavorful, about 10 minutes. Add rice cakes and simmer until plump, about 8 minutes.
Add edamame and bok choy leaves and stir until bright green, about 1 minute. Swirl in the beaten eggs in a slow, steady stream, stirring gently to make sure the eggs form long ribbons. Stir in the vinegar; season with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls and top with remaining scallion greens.
