Ginger-Lime Chicken

INGREDIENTS
1 ½ to 2  pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts
 Kosher salt and black pepper
⅓  cup mayonnaise
1  tablespoon lime zest (from about 2 limes), plus lime wedges, for serving
1  tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger (from a 3-inch piece of peeled ginger)

PREPARATION
Pat the chicken dry and season all over with 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, lime zest and ginger; season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken to the mayonnaise mixture and stir to coat. (The chicken can sit in the marinade for up to 8 hours in the fridge. Let come to room temperature before cooking.)
To grill: Heat a grill to medium-high. Grill the chicken over direct heat until cooked through and juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side for thighs and about 4 minutes per side for breasts, turning as necessary to avoid burning.
To cook in a skillet: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Cook the chicken until juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side for thighs and about 4 minutes per side for breasts.
Serve chicken with lime wedges, for squeezing on top.
