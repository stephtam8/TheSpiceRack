Creamy Vegan Hot Chocolate

INGREDIENTS
⅓  cup vegan semisweet chocolate chips (about 2 ounces)
3  tablespoons vegan unsweetened cocoa powder
3  tablespoons creamy nut or seed butter, such as almond, sunflower or peanut
 Pinch of kosher salt
1 ½ to 2  cups unsweetened nut or grain milk, such as macadamia, walnut, almond, cashew, hazelnut, oat or rice milk
1 to 3  teaspoons granulated sugar (optional)

PREPARATION
Combine chocolate chips, cocoa powder, nut butter, salt and 1/2 cup nut or grain milk in a small saucepan. Whisk over medium heat until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth, about 1 1/2 minutes.
Whisk in 1 cup nut or grain milk in a slow, steady stream, and continue whisking until cocoa is steaming, about 1 1/2 minutes. Don’t let it come to a boil or the cocoa will separate.
Taste a spoonful. (Be careful: It’s hot.) If you prefer a thinner hot cocoa, add up to 1/2 cup additional milk. If you prefer it sweeter, add a teaspoon of sugar at a time, tasting after each addition. Divide among cups and serve hot.
