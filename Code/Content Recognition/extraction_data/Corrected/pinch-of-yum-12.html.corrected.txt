Sarah’s White Chicken Chili

INGREDIENTS
4–5 strips of bacon
1–2 jalapeños, ribs and seeds removed
half of a yellow onion
3 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons cumin
2 teaspoons chili powder
2 cups chicken broth
two 14-ounce cans diced tomatoes with green chiles (with juices!)
1.25 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs (you can also use chicken breasts – I like it both ways)
one 14-ounce can pinto beans
one 14-ounce can black beans
8 ounces cream cheese

INSTRUCTIONS
Food processor prep: Pulse the bacon through the food processor until it looks like a chunky paste. Remove bacon and do the same with the onion, garlic, and jalapeño.
Cook bacon and veggies: Add the bacon to a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Once the bacon starts heating up, add the onion, garlic, and jalapeño mix so it all cooks together.
Build the soup: Add spices, broth, and tomatoes. Bring to a simmer.
Cook chicken: Add chicken. Bring to a low simmer. Cover and cook for 15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove, cool, and shred.
Tie it all up: Stir in the shredded chicken, beans, and cream cheese.  The chili will be THICK, especially as it cools. It’s almost like a dip because, yes, we are monsters. Thin it out with water as you like!
Top and serve: Serve with every good thing under the sun, but mostly tortilla chips, cilantro, green onion, and cheese.
