Super Moist Pumpkin Bread

INGREDIENTS
4 eggs
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/2 cup olive oil
2 cups white sugar
1 15-ounce can pumpkin (not pie filling – just regular pumpkin purée)
1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup water
3 1/2 cups all purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons salt
1 heaping teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 cup melted butter
1/4 cup turbinado sugar

INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Whisk the eggs, oils, and sugar together until smooth. Add the pumpkin, milk, and water – whisk until smooth.
Stir in the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.
Transfer batter to two 9x5inch loaf pans lined with parchment paper. Bake for 35 minutes. Remove from oven, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with turbinado sugar, and return to oven for another 5-10 minutes to set the sugar. The bread should be golden brown and firm to the touch when done, and a toothpick inserted should come out clean. When in doubt, I’d say err on the side of underbaking since it yields a most moist bread. The longer it bakes the more possibility you have that the bread will dry out.
Let cool slightly before slicing and serving. Store in the refrigerator.
