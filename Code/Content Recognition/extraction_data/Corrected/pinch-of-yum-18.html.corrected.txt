Baked Shrimp with Feta and Grilled Sourdough

INGREDIENTS
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 shallot, minced
1 bell pepper, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes
1 cup chicken or vegetable broth
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
1 lb. uncooked shrimp
8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled
fresh chopped parsley and lemon wedges for serving
6–8 thick slices of sourdough bread
4 tablespoons butter for the bread

INSTRUCTIONS
Sauté the veggies: Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium high heat (I like to use a wide, shallow Dutch oven). Add the shallot and bell pepper; sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
Make the tomato sauce: Turn the heat down. Add the tomatoes, garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, and broth; simmer until the sauce reduces and gets a little darker in color, about 10 minutes.
Grill the sourdough: While the sauce simmers, grill your sourdough. Melt the butter, brush it on the bread, and grill in a pan (ideally a grill pan) until crispy and golden brown. Wrap in foil and keep warm in the oven.
Add the shrimp: Add the shrimp into the tomato sauce in a single layer. The shrimp will cook right in the sauce – keep on the heat for about 5 minutes, flipping the shrimp once, until the shrimp are no longer translucent.
Broil: Turn the broiler on. Sprinkle feta on top. Transfer to the oven and broil for 5 minutes or until the feta is browned. Serve with a sprinkling of fresh parsley. Serve with grilled sourdough and juicy little lemon wedges.
