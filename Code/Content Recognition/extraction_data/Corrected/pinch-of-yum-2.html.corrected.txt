old school homemade oreos

INGREDIENTS
2 eggs
3/4 cup butter, room temperature
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1 box Devil’s Food cake mix
8 oz. cream cheese
1/2 cup butter
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups powdered sugar

INSTRUCTIONS
Beat cookie ingredients together with an electric mixer until combined. 
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Roll into small one or two tablespoon balls. Place on a baking sheet. (Chill the dough for about 30 minutes if it’s too soft to roll.)
Bake for 8 minutes. Remove and allow to cool.
Beat frosting ingredients together with an electric mixer. Using a plastic bag with the end cut off, or a pastry bag, pipe a swirl of frosting onto one cookie and gently press a same-size cookie on top. Voila! Store in the refrigerator – or on  your cold porch if you live in Minnesota!
