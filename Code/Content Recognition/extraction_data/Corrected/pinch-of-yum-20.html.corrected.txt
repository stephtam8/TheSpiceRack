Creamy Red Pepper Pasta with Blistered Tomatoes

INGREDIENTS
1 lb. rigatoni (DeLallo brand)
2–3 cups cherry tomatoes
a quick swish of olive oil (DeLallo brand)
salt and pepper
1 1/4 cup cashews
1/4 cup olive oil
1 1/2 cups water
1 large roasted red pepper (DeLallo brand – not a whole jar, just one, or if you’re using sliced red peppers, about 1/2 cup)
1 clove garlic
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (optional)
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
chives and basil for topping

INSTRUCTIONS
Pasta: Cook pasta according to package directions.
Tomatoes: Preheat the broiler. On a baking sheet, toss cherry tomatoes with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Broil for 10-15 minutes until very roasty.
Sauce: Meanwhile, blend up your sauce ingredients in a blender until *very* smooth and creamy. Pour over hot cooked pasta (off heat) and stir to mix – it should cling well to the pasta.
Serve: Serve with tomatoes over the top, as well as herbs and more salt and pepper.
