biscuits and gravy egg bake

INGREDIENTS
1 lb. Appleton Farms Premium Pork Sausage
4 tablespoons butter
4 tablespoons flour
2 cups Simply Nature Organic Whole Milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 can Pueblo Lindo Chopped Green Chiles
8 Simply Nature Organic Cage Free Eggs
1/2 cup Simply Nature Organic Whole Milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
12-ounce tube of Bake House Creations Jumbo Buttermilk Biscuits (about 6–8 biscuits), cut into small cubes
1 cup Happy Farms Shredded Mild Cheddar Cheese

INSTRUCTIONS
Cook the Sausage: Brown the sausage in a large cast iron skillet. Remove from pan. Drain off excess grease.
Make the Gravy: Melt butter in the same cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour; stir until thickened, 2-3 minutes. Whisk in the milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, until a smooth gravy comes together. Add salt, diced green chiles, and sausage back to the gravy. Stir to combine. 
Whisk the Eggs: In a separate bowl, whisk eggs with milk and salt. 
Assemble the Egg Bake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place half of the biscuits over the bottom of a greased 9×13 pan. Pour eggs over top. Sprinkle with cheese and dollop with some of the gravy (but save some gravy for later). Arrange with remaining biscuits. Bake for 35 minutes, until eggs are set. 
Eat Up: Serve slices warm from the oven, with a scoop of that green chile sausage gravy over the top (thin it out with a little more milk so it’s semi-pourable, since it usually thickens as it cools). Brunch dreams realized.
