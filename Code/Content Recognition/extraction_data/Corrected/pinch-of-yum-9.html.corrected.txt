Sweet Potato Casserole with Brown Sugar Topping

INGREDIENTS
3 cups (1 29-ounce can) sweet potatoes, drained
1/2 cup melted butter
1/3 cup milk
3/4 cup cane sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 beaten eggs
salt to taste
5 tablespoons melted butter
2/3 cup brown sugar
2/3 cup flour
1 cup pecan pieces

INSTRUCTIONS
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Mash the sweet potatoes and add the melted butter, milk, sugar, vanilla, beaten eggs, and a pinch of salt. Stir until incorporated. Pour into a shallow baking dish or a cast iron skillet.
Combine the butter, brown sugar, flour, and pecan pieces in a small bowl, using your fingers to create moist crumbs. Sprinkle generously over the casserole. Bake for 25-35 minutes, until the edges pull away from the sides of the pan and the top is golden brown. Let stand for the mixture to cool and solidify a little bit before serving.
