<p>I see you, hungry reader whose life is crazy right now, who has a hard time finding the time to cook even though you love food, who opens the fridge to grab a quick lunch to take to work in the morning rush only to find NOTHING that seems good enough, who values&nbsp;the big bowl of comfort food pasta above all else, who&nbsp;is not asking for much other than GOOD FOOD that is made for REAL LIFE.</p>



<p>I see you. I know you think I&#8217;m not watching because I&#8217;m on the other side of this computer-ma-jig, but I&#8217;m watching (um, in a not-creepy and not-literal way &#8211; just felt like I should clarify. pls don&#8217;t leave.).</p>



<p>So since I see you and understand you because I am just like you in these feelings, today&nbsp;I honor you (us?) with this super cozy, big-time nutritious, easy to prepare soup.</p>



<p>This is called Detox Crockpot Lentil Soup, which means nothing scientifically as you&#8217;ll notice that my bowl of DETOX soup is topped with a few thick chunks of Parmesan cheese and served with that addicting crusty-warm bread. Right, about that. We did sneak a few good foods into this soup (kale, onions, garlic, carrots, and olive oil) and anyways, in my book, the best kinds of healthy foods are the ones that ACTUALLY TASTE GOOD.</p>



<p>And while this soup tastes good without the extras, it tastes BETTER with them. Cue the bread and cheese.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-makes-this-lentil-soup-so-good">What Makes This Lentil Soup So Good</h2>



<p>As is my goal with most recipes I make for Pinch of Yum, this crockpot lentil soup was made for real life. Because it&#8217;s literally for my real life.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re starting with a solid base: onions, garlic, carrots, celery, spices, salt, and broth.</p>



<p>Then we&#8217;re getting awesome by adding butternut squash, which partially melts into a creamy textured miracle, lentils (always lentils), and yellow split peas because WOW color.</p>



<p>After all this simmers&nbsp;up into the best house smells and then we do the magic thing that takes it over the top: puree a portion of the soup with that olive oil to form a silky emulsion that then gets added back into the soup. YES PLZ 4EVR.</p>



<p>I ended mine with a splash of sherry and red wine vinegar&nbsp;because I&#8217;m currently having a moment with tangy foods.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on in this soup, but if you want to round it out for a whole meal, I&#8217;d recommend a few extras:</p>

That&#8217;s the soup. SO EASY. It requires a bit of front-end chopping to prep the veggies, but I&#8217;d guess it took me 30-45 minutes to cut everything up and get it in the crockpot, and in return I was gifted with 8 soup servings of this nutritious + cozy wonderfood. NOT A BAD DEAL.</p>



<p>Cheers to you and your people enjoying many glowing bowls of crockpot lentil soup for all the days to come. 👍👍👍</p>

<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1603217097975"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What type of lentils should I use in this soup?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">We&#8217;d recommend brown or green lentils. Red lentils are &#8220;split&#8221; which means they&#8217;ll soften a lot faster.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1603217225387"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Can you make this soup in the Instant Pot?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes! Place the first group of ingredients below in the Instant Pot and cook on the soup setting for 30 minutes with a quick release at the end. Follow the same blending instructions and then add kale and parsley.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1603217346861"><strong class="schema-faq-question">My lentils are still hard! How do I fix this?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Let the soup cook a little longer on the high setting to soften them up! If using the Instant Pot, you could re-pressurize to cook for another 5 minutes, or turn on the sauté mode until they soften.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1603217450476"><strong class="schema-faq-question">How big of a crockpot or Instant Pot do I need to use?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">This makes a lot of soup! We&#8217;d recommend at least a 6-qt. for both.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1603217580839"><strong class="schema-faq-question">Can you freeze this lentil soup?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Yes! You could freeze leftovers to keep in the freezer for three months, or make it a freezer meal by following the instructions in the recipe card notes or by checking out <a href="https://pinchofyum.com/freezer-meals">this post</a>.</p> </div> </div>

<li id="instruction-step-2">Place about 4 cups of soup in a blender with the olive oil. Pulse gently until semi-smooth and creamy-looking (the oil will form a creamy emulsion with the soup). Add back to the pot and stir to combine. Stir in the kale and parsley. Turn the heat off and just let everything chill out for a bit before serving. The taste gets better with time and so does the texture, IMO!<br /><div class="tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container-0510bcfe"><iframe loading="lazy" class="fitvidsignore" title="Detox Lentil Soup Step 2" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/401032911?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963&#038;autoplay=0&#038;muted=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;loop=1&#038;controls=1"   frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></li>

								<p>I suggest seeing a doctor because it sounds like you&#8217;re having severe lived problems. Your liver removes all toxins/bad stuff for you, so if you&#8217;re having to &#8220;detox&#8221; yourself, your liver is probably failing.</p>

								<p>Wooww that&#8217;s  not at all what this is talking about but okay. And hello there are plenty of toxins we expose our bodies to on a daily basis that your liver is unable to fully filter out no matter how healthy it is. Eating good healthy food does actually help with that. It boosts your liver as well as your digestive and immune system. Don&#8217;t comment on something just for the sake of being rude.</p>

								<p>Haha agreed. The &#8216;detox&#8217; gimmick has gone too far.  On another note, I made this soup and it is divine, even without the promise of &#8216;inner purity&#8217;.</p>

								<p>I think the whole &#8220;detox&#8221; thing was written as a joke and yes, to catch more readers. I don&#8217;t think any lentil soup is detoxifying, but yes, celery and kale are foods that help detoxify the body when eaten minus the soup. Lol</p>

								<p>This is the best soup ever I tried and I am a lentil lover wow.<br />
Christy, if you don&#8217;t like it just leave instead of being smarty pants. You are not just rude you are uneducated because if you know the nutrition value of lentils you will say something like that.</p>

								<p>Yes, you can easily make this on the stovetop. Saute the carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in olive oil. Add in the seasonings. Then add in the lentils, peas, potatoes, squash, and broth. Simmer until the veggies are tender. Then continue onto Step #2 of the recipe!</p>

								<p>Christy, you seem to be one of those people who assume a little bit of knowledge gives you full knowledge. It doesn&#8217;t. It should just make you want to learn more. If you don&#8217;t follow up and learn nothing more, you were better off not knowing anything at all.</p>

								<p>Soup soup soup! I used to hate soup because my mom would make it eve-ry single day and it tasted so méh to me&#8230; but now, I I learned to make it myself from scratch. Chopping those onions, stirring all the veggies, mixing it all and poooff adding a little parmezan. Yes! I already made soup today but I&#8217;m gonna add this one to my &#8216;to make&#8217; list. Thanks Lindsay </p>

								<p>This looks so cosy. I love soups with split peas in them as they&#8217;re so satisfying and filling even without the bread. But of course the bread makes everything better and the cheese is just a no-brainer! Gorgeous photos as always!</p>

								<p>I made the soup with rutabaga, a.low calorie, healthy substitute for white potatoes.  Just discovering this alternative which held together in the soup.  The soup is delicious.</p>

								<p>I used both sweet potatoes and regular and didn’t bother peeling them as that’s where a lot of the nutrition is. It came out DELISH!</p>

								<p>Mmmm! I made a soup really similar to this the other day, but now i&#8217;m wishing I had added split peas to it! Also I made a easy vegan parm cheese with almonds and nutritional yeast if you decide to go the full &#8220;detox&#8221; route 🙂</p>

								<p>While not a have-to, pretty much all grains and legumes get soaked at my house.  I would soak in salted water, rinse well, and proceed with the recipe.  You might want to go with the lesser cooking time, but crockpots can vary so much anyway.</p>

								<p>I didn’t soak the lentils and split peas but I think I will next time. And yes, the soup was delicious and definitely there will be a next time! The dried legumes were still a bit crunchy after 8 hours in the crockpot so I’ll try soaking them first.</p>

								<p>I think the only thing those photos are missing is a warm fire in the background because all that cozy and vivid color just has me curled up with a blanket!  This is what my sickly (recovering) self is craving and then you added lentils and a crockpot&#8230;SOLD. &lt;3</p>

								<p>This looks amazing!  I have never tried a lentil soup in the crock pot.  I make butter bean soup in the slow cooker which is amazing.  Funny too that I just reposted it last night with new pictures.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homeecathome.com/the-home-economist/slow-cooker-butter-bean-soup" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.homeecathome.com/the-home-economist/slow-cooker-butter-bean-soup</a>  You would die if you saw the old picture.  It was seriously bad!  I will have to put this soup on my &#8220;to make&#8221; list.</p>

								<p>Hmm we&#8217;re not sure that red lentils would work well here since, like you said, they cook faster and might overcook if you cook the soup for the same amount of time. You could try cooking the lentils separately and adding them to the soup once everything is done.</p>

								<p>I cooked lentil soup by adding various veggies depending of season,  but adding butternut squash for additional creaminess is something I just have to try it &#8211; asap 🙂</p>

								<p>Just finished this recipe at 3:30am because when I came across it on Facebook it was about 4pm and I couldn&#8217;t wait to try it because it looked so good! I mist say it came out delicious! Well worth waking up in the middle of the night! I&#8217;m also obsessed with lentil soup and split pea soup and was afraid to learn the recipe because I knew I&#8217;d be making it all the time. We&#8217;ll, I already can&#8217;t wait to make this delicious soup again!</p>

								<p>I so want to try this!  My problem is that with my work schedule I&#8217;m usually out of the house for at least 9 hours, sometimes more, and most things in the crockpot turn to mush by then.  Any suggestions?  Do you think this dish will hold up for that long?</p>

								<p>I do, if you turn it on low. It gets mushy anyways, like the squash sort of breaks down which is why the broth is more creamy and yellow. Otherwise if you&#8217;re really nervous I would make it on a weekend &#8211; it makes so much that then you&#8217;d have it for the week. 🙂</p>

								<p>I actually had an issue with the lentils and split peas getting soft, even after 7 hours and wound up leaving it cooking all night long! I turned it down to super low (I have temperature settings, not low/high) and it was fine in the morning. We didn&#8217;t eat that night and are about to dig in tonight!</p>

								<p>I have a bag of lentils burning a hole in my pantry and was going to make classic Greek lentil soup this week&#8211;change of plans!! </p>
<p>Thoughts on using frozen butternut squash for this? I have a bag that I&#8217;ve had for MONTHS, but I&#8217;m worried it&#8217;ll water down the soup too much.  And since everything goes in at once, I&#8217;m worried I won&#8217;t be able to adjust for the extra moisture (if there is any). Thanks in advance!</p>

								<p>Thank you!! I made this yesterday and it is FAB. I made some adjustments:</p>
<p>&#8211; sweet potatoes for reg potaotes<br />
&#8211; no squash<br />
&#8211; a full cup of yellow peas/1.5 cups lentils/8 cups of broth (I wanted it a little less soup-y)<br />
&#8211; skipped the blending part (to make oil-free)<br />
&#8211; only cooked for 4ish hours on high (impatient!!)</p>
<p>Served with shaved parm and rye Wasa crackers. SO GOOD!! Thank you again!</p>
