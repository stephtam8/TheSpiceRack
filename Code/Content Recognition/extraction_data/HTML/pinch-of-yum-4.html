<p>Holiday times mean big food times, and big food times mean WE START WITH BRUNCH.</p>



<p>My love for this biscuits and gravy egg bake is borderline over-the-top. There are zero things not to love about a casserole-style dish of fluffy eggs and cheddar baked up with little bites of tender flaky biscuit pieces poking out the top, and buried under a blanket of creamy, savory, mildly spicy green chile sausage gravy. </p>



<p>It is THE brunch dish of 2020 for me because:</p>



<ul><li>It&#8217;s so easy.</li><li>It&#8217;s a crowd favorite.</li><li>Each piece gets smothered in green chile gravy.</li><li>Repeat: green chile gravy.</li><li>And how about just a little more gravy.</li><li>It&#8217;s really, really delicious.</li></ul>



<p>I like to pick up all the ingredients for this at ALDI: Simply Nature Organic <strong>Whole Milk</strong>, Simply Nature Organic Cage Free <strong>Eggs</strong>, Bake House Creations Jumbo Buttermilk <strong>Biscuits</strong>, Appleton Farms Premium Pork <strong>Sausage</strong>, Pueblo Lindo Chopped <strong>Green Chiles</strong> and really good Happy Farms Shredded Mild <strong>Cheddar Cheese</strong>. Super short ingredient list.</p>

<p>If I manage to venture out to the store, even though I have a short list, what are the chances I find a few other yummy ALDI holiday treats waiting for me on the shelves? 100%.</p>



<p>But also, what about if you&#8217;re not wanting to / able to leave the house right now? VERY RELATABLE. You can shop ALDI via Instacart which is how I do 90% of my real-life ALDI shopping. Not sure about you, but I almost always have to work a little harder to make my cart total get past $35 for free delivery because ALDI is so affordable! Oh darn, looks like I need to throw in a few extra boxes of our favorite wheat crackers, a couple of packages of amazing marinated olives, and at least three bricks of goat cheese with blueberries. Shoot. Bummer. &#8230;How soon can it get here?</p>



<p>Okay, biscuits and gravy egg bake. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what happens: we just layer all the good things. Whisked eggs, biscuits, cheddar cheese, green chile sausage gravy&#8230;</p>

<p>And bake. </p>



<p>And cover with more sausage gravy.</p>

<p>We might just need to call it like it is: the holidays are probably a little weird for most of us right now. A brunch with close family and friends can make it seem just a little more normal. Even if that brunch is for a smaller group than we&#8217;d wish for.</p>



<p>Food is my ultimate favorite way to bring little joys into the everyday, and in this season, HOLY SMOKES we need those little joys! We need that biscuits and gravy egg bake. We need extra sausage gravy. Whisk the eggs, grate the cheese, pop the biscuit pieces in there, and let&#8217;s eat. </p>



<p>Easy biscuits and gravy egg bake brunch for the win.</p>

<li id="instruction-step-1"><strong>Cook the Sausage:</strong> Brown the sausage in a large cast iron skillet. Remove from pan. Drain off excess grease.<br /><div class="tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container-b4790f97"><iframe loading="lazy" class="fitvidsignore" title="Biscuits and Gravy Egg Bake Step 1" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/487370719?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963&#038;autoplay=0&#038;muted=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;loop=1&#038;controls=1"   frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></li>
<li id="instruction-step-2"><strong>Make the Gravy:</strong> Melt butter in the same cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour; stir until thickened, 2-3 minutes. Whisk in the milk, about 1/2 cup at a time, until a smooth gravy comes together. Add salt, diced green chiles, and sausage back to the gravy. Stir to combine. <br /><div class="tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container-345671ec"><iframe loading="lazy" class="fitvidsignore" title="Biscuits and Gravy Egg Bake Step 2" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/487370787?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963&#038;autoplay=0&#038;muted=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;loop=1&#038;controls=1"   frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></li>
<li id="instruction-step-3"><strong>Whisk the Eggs:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk eggs with milk and salt. <br /><div class="tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container-3ba894b2"><iframe loading="lazy" class="fitvidsignore" title="Biscuits and Gravy Egg Bake Step 3" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/487370975?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963&#038;autoplay=0&#038;muted=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;loop=1&#038;controls=1"   frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></li>
<li id="instruction-step-4"><strong>Assemble the Egg Bake:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place half of the biscuits over the bottom of a greased 9&#215;13 pan. Pour eggs over top. Sprinkle with cheese and dollop with some of the gravy (but save some gravy for later). Arrange with remaining biscuits. Bake for 35 minutes, until eggs are set. <br /><div class="tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container-9592eec4"><iframe loading="lazy" class="fitvidsignore" title="Biscuits and Gravy Egg Bake Step 4" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/487371062?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963&#038;autoplay=0&#038;muted=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;loop=1&#038;controls=1"   frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></li>
<li id="instruction-step-5"><strong>Eat Up:</strong> Serve slices warm from the oven, with a scoop of that green chile sausage gravy over the top (thin it out with a little more milk so it&#8217;s semi-pourable, since it usually thickens as it cools). Brunch dreams realized.<br /><div class="tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container tasty-recipe-responsive-iframe-container-4e535e68"><iframe loading="lazy" class="fitvidsignore" title="Biscuits and Gravy Egg Bake Step 5" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/487371220?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963&#038;autoplay=0&#038;muted=1&#038;autopause=0&#038;loop=1&#038;controls=1"   frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></li>

								<p>The sausage gravy recipes i use call for the flour to be incorporated into the sausage before slowly adding the milk.<br />
Is there a particular reason you wait until the gravy is thickened to add the sausage and green chili?<br />
PS, I can hardly believe I&#8217;ve never thought of adding green chilis to my gravy! Thanks for the tip!</p>

								<p>We made this but it came out soupy &#8211; I think I may have put too much gravy in the dish?! How much do you mean by dollop with “some”? 1/4 of the gravy? Less than half? We will try again!</p>

								<p>This was the first recipe I&#8217;ve tried that I didn&#8217;t like&#8230; And it&#8217;s all because of the processed biscuits. I generally make everything I can from scratch but decided to give this a try. A good reminder that I&#8217;ll never buy biscuits like this again.  It surprised me that they were used actually, as generally all your recipes are from scratch!</p>

								<p>This was SO GOOD! I have made biscuit and gravy for years ad never thought to put green chiles in the gravy. I also put some in the egg mixture. We have fabulous green chilies here in Colorado that made this so good. thanks!</p>
