<p>Let the record show: if I could eat this creamy, cozy, veggie korma for every cold-weather meal, I&#8217;d be a very happy person.</p>



<p>(Which, honestly, is kind of what I&#8217;ve been doing lately. A little here for lunch, a little there for dinner, a little the next day with some added paneer because I love myself&#8230;)</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to know that this recipe has so much flavor, but it&#8217;s also not LOUD flavor. It&#8217;s like rich, cozy, mellow, could-keep-eating-forever flavor.</p>

<p>The base of this veggie korma is a boatload of comforting vegetables like fork-tender potatoes, bell peppers, and green beans, but the thing that makes it feel like a hug is that creamy golden sauce. We&#8217;re giving a gentle sauté to a careful amount of aromatic onion, garlic, ginger, cardamom, coriander, and other spices, and then adding a bit of cream and yogurt to make this the kind of recipe that lands in the perfect exciting-but-gentle flavor zone. </p>



<p>Scooped up hot over a pile of steamy basmati rice&#8230; oof. Game over. We can survive winter with this.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the kind of big-flavor-cozy recipe where you can practically finish the entire pan in one sitting.</p>



<p>Direct quote from a family member on his second? third? plate piled high with veggie korma: &#8220;I feel like I could just keep eating and eating and eating this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, me too, amen.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size"><em>I based this recipe off the Vegetable Korma recipe from a 2008 cookbook called <a href="https://amzn.to/2R9Bfm1">Best Ever Indian Cookbook</a> by Mridula Baljekar, which is just a gem of a book. It has always been one of my favorite sources for Indian recipes because of the step by step photos, and every recipe I&#8217;ve tried over the years has been awesome (and there have been many). The changes I made from the original include subbing some ground spices in place of whole spices and adjusting the veggie-to-liquid ratios a bit.</em> <em>For a more in-depth look at Indian food including influences, methods, definitions, and more, check out this <strong>amazing</strong> post called <a href="https://simmertoslimmer.com/indian-food-101/">Indian Cooking 101</a> by our friend Anu from Simmer to Slimmer!</em></p>

<p><strong>Spice Substitutions: </strong>The cookbook I studied up on recommended using whole spices when possible &#8211; for example, cinnamon sticks and dried red chile peppers, as this is the traditional way to build the flavor base in a lot of Indian cooking. I often don&#8217;t have cinnamon sticks or whole dried red chile peppers on hand, so I&#8217;m just sharing what I use instead which is ground cinnamon and red pepper flakes. But if you have the whole spices, go ahead and use them! </p>

								<p>I couldn&#8217;t find the paneer anywhere either. I Googled substitutions for paneer and found something called halloumi. It is made from goat and sheep milk and is a product of Greece. It cost me $9  for half a pound. I plan on making this recipe tonight.</p>

								<p>The implication that sharing this recipe is wrong seems a little unfair to me. It’s hard to think of concrete ways in which this may hurt other bloggers or speak to the (important) issues at the center of the current race discourse. More personally, as a Latin American, I love seeing Latin American food (e.g., arroz con pollo) represented in this space—and executed so well too. Keep up the good work!</p>

								<p>Is it right to cook Indian food if you are not Indian then? Should I refrain from cooking any food that is not Spanish because that is where I am from, so I do not hurt anyone? Please, lets be a little more open minded. Cooking is a great way to embrace other cultures and traditions, but that is just my opinion.</p>

								<p>I am an Indian food blogger living in India cooking everyday in my Indian kitchen and 80 percent of the recipes that I share on my site are NOT INDIAN! I share recipes that I like and I think Lindsay is doing the same thing? How is that a bad thing if someone wants to share recipes that they enjoy?</p>

								<p>I really appreciate that on POY&#8217;s Instagram stories they always have a slide that contains a disclaimer about the origins of the recipe and gives credit to the culture from which it originates&#8211;it would be cool if they would do that here, too, rather than just the very small print explanation of the recipe source at the bottom of the post.</p>

								<p>This was delicious and will definitely be made again! I had to do some substitutions based upon what was in the fridge/pantry and it still turned out great. Perfect way to use up extra veggies!<br />
My subs for reference: chickpeas instead of paneer, subbed one potato for a sweet potato, turned out I had no cardamom, and low fat yogurt.</p>

1. What would you add to make it a little spicier? My husband likes spicy foods.<br />

								<p>A pinch of cayenne or red pepper flakes would give it a spicy kick! We haven&#8217;t tried freezing the korma, so we can&#8217;t say for sure. If you give it a try, know that the coconut milk may separate. Enjoy!</p>

								<p>I made this for dinner on a whim tonight, without all the ingredients but did some substitutions based on what I had and even with those substitutions it was DIVINE. Here&#8217;s what I subbed:<br />
&#8211; soy milk instead of heavy cream<br />
&#8211; sour cream mixed with water instead of yogurt<br />
&#8211; broccoli instead of green beans<br />
&#8211; tofu instead of paneer<br />
The spice blend and aromatics combined to make a warm, cozy, comforting sauce that blanketed everything and made my soul happy. If you&#8217;re thinking about making this tonight, just do it. You won&#8217;t regret it!</p>

								<p>Yum! This was so easy to make, and smelt divine whilst being cooked. A very tasty korma 🙂 I used halloumi instead of paneer (as that&#8217;s what I had in the fridge already) and added some cashew nuts. Definitely adding to my &#8216;to make again&#8217; list, particularly as it could be so easily adapted for whatever veg are in season.</p>

								<p>wow.. followed the recipe exactly except for paneer&#8230; substituted halloumi. It was a TEENY bit spicey hot, so would even use less red pepper flakes. Suggestion: make sure you really salt the potatoes when adding, as it was super bland at that point. Yum!</p>

								<p>I can&#8217;t wait to make this with coconut milk instead of the cream. I think that&#8217;ll taste incredible. We&#8217;re trying to eat a lot more veggies, and this will very a yummy way to accomplish that!</p>

								<p>Made this tonight- delish!!! Substituted with a (jersey) sweet potato, coconut cream and coconut yogurt. Didn’t have bell pepper SO Added zucchini, carrots, green peas and chicken broth. The spices make this so warming and flavorful! Definitely a feel good “cozy” dinner</p>
