0.0	0.0	This one pot recipe which makes a holiday table centerpiece with leftovers you ll be thankful for is adapted from Sabrina Ghayour s book Simply Cooking a lean cut of meat like brisket see note below for an extended period of time in a moist environment yields meat that is in Sabrina s words ridiculously juicy and tender with plenty of flavor She recommends serving it with mashed root vegetables or shredded up and served with flatbread yogurt and a dash of pomegranate molasses pomegranate seeds and some fresh herbs such as mint Leftovers make for an excellent sandwich or pot pie filling or combine them with a can of coconut milk and serve over rice for a comforting stew

0.0	0.0	The seasoning was wonderful and I ll use it again My roast was up to temperature in 4 hrs and looked beautiful However I found that by tying it the grain became very dense and it was more like a roast beef grain then a braised brisket So I would not make it rolled again Also the directions say to unroll it before you slice it This can t be correct since it says to tie it on the long side so when you cut it it s against the grain It would be very messy to try and unroll
