0.0	0.0	The only thing better than soup with bread Soup that not only has chunks of bread in it but crunchy croutons on top as well This vegetarian Italian classic is about as comforting as it gets packed with hearty greens meaty beans and plenty of rich olive oil and umami packed Parmesan A note on that cheese If you ve been throwing out your Parm rinds all these years that stops right now The rind is full of flavor and makes a great addition to any broth y stewy situation

0.0	0.0	Discovered Ribollita this year having grown an excess if that s possible of Kale during Furlough One key to the flavour is frying off the tomatoes so they are deep deep colour I do the same for my Pizza sauce as it gives an intense tomato flavour in the back of the nose Another is to use a well baked bread I use my own sourdough that I bake with a dark crust the Maillard Reaction is key to lifting the tones of the overall bake As a vegan I replace the parmesan with nutritional yeast lactic acid maple syrup and extra garlic and salt Superb

0.0	0.0	Mmmmm mmmmm good Substituted chard for kale Used the liquid from the canned white beans I took the lead from another chef and made croutons separately and added them to the top of each individual serving Otherwise no crunch for the leftovers This bread stew is filling without the heavy feeling of overeating The garlic is key Don t skimp on it

0.0	0.0	I have made this soup countless times since viewing the recipe Sometimes I use kale sometimes Swiss chard any leafing green vegetable will work wonderfully I approach it like Stone Soup based on the children s book adding whatever vegetables I have in my fridge that need to be used now string beans cabbage broccoli whatever It will only increase the flavor and the virtue of hearty healthy soup I do use chicken or vegetable broth instead of water DON T omit the parmesan it adds a whole extra level of depth and flavor ALWAYS a winner with my entire family

0.0	0.0	Wow This soup is amazing The whole family is crazy about it Such flavour I followed the recipe despite being a bit dubious about adding four cups of water because I know bon appetit recipes are trustworthy and I was right to do so I didn t have enough kale in the garden so I substituted Swiss Chard and it was lovely Thanks for a great recipe

0.0	0.0	I love this soup so hearty and comforting But if you anticipate leftovers I strongly recommend toasting the remaining 2 3 of bread step 14 separately and adding to top each individual bowl as it s reheated and served This makes leftovers vastly improved as the contrast between soft bread and crunchy croutons is maintained which is the best part I also cut up the soft cooked Parmesan rind into little cheese croutons and serve in the soup yes Parm rind is edible and delicious
