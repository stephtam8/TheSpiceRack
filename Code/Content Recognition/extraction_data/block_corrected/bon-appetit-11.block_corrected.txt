0.0	0.0	This isn t your classic beautifully layered lasagna but it is a little more weeknight friendly Instead of boiling the noodles in one pot and making the sauce in another you cook lasagna noodles directly in a mixture of milk crème fraîche water and a little lemon zest which thickens arounds the pasta as it bubbles away You can use sour cream in place of crème fraîche to keep it from breaking temper it with a little of the hot milk then whisk in thoroughly The key to success is using a big enough pan a large sauté pan or skillet with high sides or a Dutch oven that holds at least four quarts We pop the lasagna in the broiler for a crispy top but you can add the mozzarella in the last few minutes on the stove if you don t want to turn the oven on

0.0	0.0	Hard pass This recipe uses a lot of good ingredients but the result was disappointing Despite using creme fraiche and whole milk the sauce stuck to the pan and broke and the lasagna noodles ripped as I stirred it Your results are very much dependent upon the skillet you use and this recipe does not offer enough guidance as to the size which probably explains why many reviewers had issues with the sauce not thickening properly The end result is not worth the effort Also 2 Tablespoons of thyme is way too much

0.0	0.0	This recipe is outstanding Very filling and very satisfying My 6 year old who can t even stand to look at a mushroom ate every bite Not in the weekly rotation due to the amount of steps and dishes but definitely worth the time to make about once a month As other reviewers have stated the sauce takes longer than 6 minutes to thicken It was more like 15 minutes Be sure that you take the time to separate the noodles to ensure that the sauce gets into all the nooks and crannies I ll definitely be making this again My wife and I have already started to think of some substitutions and additions to compliment it One thing I would have liked to see or maybe not is the nutritional info

0.0	0.0	Amazing dinner I followed the recipe as written but added more garlic because i love garlic and used dried thyme because I didn t have fresh I made it in an iron skillet and had no problem with the pasta sticking to the bottom It did take a little longer for the sauce to thicken but I am sure that was due to the heat control This is definitely a keeper and I will make again

0.0	0.0	This was delicious Made exactly as directed except for dried thyme instead of fresh so reduced amount accordingly BIG hit Thickening the sauce does take longer than stated but welll worth the extra maybe 10 minutes Made in a le creuset paella shape no sticking plenty of room and pretty for presentation Definitely will be a repeat worthy staple

0.0	0.0	This recipe is great I added caramelized onions that I d just made and I don t think I would make the recipe without I think you could also add some greens maybe cooked spinach broccoli or kale You could even do crispy kale if you re feeling spicy Of course taste as you make to add necessary salt pepper because I think the recipe only calls for 1 5 tsp of salt and it definitely needs more Riff away my friends this recipe is definitely a base

0.0	0.0	It was super delicious but I decreased the rating to 4 stars because it took much longer to thicken the sauce than mentioned in the recipe and it is quite labour intensive to check if the lasagna noodles don t stick to each other Actually I will do the recipe the next time with a smaller pasta shape Nevertheless very tasty

0.0	0.0	11 09 20 prepared A couple thoughts after preparing this for our Meatless Monday worknight dinner The heat adjustments are key The opening heat is medium high but once the main elements of the sauce are assembled move the heat to low as written and let the sauce come together There is no speeding through this one Once the noodles are in the sauce and they ll float around a bit randomly until they 1 begin to soften and 2 are somewhat weighted by the mushrooms and layering you can gently spatula lift all the layers from the edge to move the sauce underneath I had no issues with the noodles sticking to the cast iron pan The broiler on high for two minutes was a great finish I used about 2 tablespoons of sour cream and filled in the rest of the 1 3 cup with buttermilk worked nicely Next time I will use more mushrooms we had small Portobello on hand and since we live in the sticks that s about as fancy a mushroom we can find until the Thanksgiving goods are at the grocer Definitely a keeper item in our weeknight dinner rotation Served with a simple romaine heart and Caesar dressing salad

0.0	0.0	I grew my own oyster mushrooms from a kit and chose this recipe to showcase them I followed the recipe almost to a T the only differences are I used the tempered sour cream I increased the amount of cheese and sprinkled some in between the layers and the cook time took more like 25 30 minutes on my gas stove on low rather than the 15 the recipe states I used the exact amount of liquid and feel like those who went wrong with this should have just had a little more patience If your noodles were scorching the bottom of the pan your heat was too high and you needed to be lifting them up occasionally with a spatula to get the liquid under there This is literally the BEST tasting thing I ve ever made and it was so relatively simple I put about 1 15 lbs of sauteed pearl mushrooms in it and the flavors all worked together so well to highlight them The lemon was the perfect accent to bring it together so don t forget that
