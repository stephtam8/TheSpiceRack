0.0	0.0	This was my second time making this dish First time I cheated and bought two bottles of charred salsa verde The enchiladas turned out really delicious and had some serious heat Second time around I decided to make the salsa verde sauce I was in the kitchen for a really long time as this dish is indeed very time consuming Overall a very tasty dish and don t skimp on frying the tortillas

0.0	0.0	Make the sauce ahead of time and make extra this recipe takes a while to make Great flavors but sauce was a little too bright for my taste maybe my tomatillos were not ripe Reserved some sauce and blended with avocado and sour cream for a mild avocado crema to top enchiladas Also added pickled red onions on top since I had some already

0.0	0.0	Fantastic I didn t make the charred salsa verde from scratch and purchased two 8oz bottles instead For the filling I added one large poblano chili finely diced and apart from the homemade salsa I followed the recipe as is The enchiladas were spicy and packed a punch but could ve been from the store bought bottles I will definitely be making again
