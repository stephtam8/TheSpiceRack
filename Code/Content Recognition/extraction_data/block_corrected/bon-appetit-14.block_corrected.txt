0.0	0.0	Not my favorite cookie was way too salty and when baked turned into a dry crumbly mess The icing coat also made it overly sweet The best thing about it was the glazed pecans which I just ate by themselves I agree with ANONYMOUS from Denver when he wrote almost Nature Valley Bar level I don t usually write negative comments but this recipe truly made my stomach hurt DO NOT TRY THIS RECIPE

0.0	0.0	I loved making this recipe and the taste is really great My concern is that once I made the cookie when it was cooled it was too crumbly to pick up to dip into the glaze I ended up having to spoon it on This was only my first time trying the recipe but does anyone have any advice on how to make the cookie stick together a little better

0.0	0.0	My main criticism is that these cookies are a little putzie Next time I ll maybe bake the pecans or make the cookie ahead of time I definitely added 2 3x as much milk to the glaze as it called for in order for it to be as thin as it called for and I don t think I needed the 2 bowls of glaze My cookie wasn t that crumbley Love the taste 10 10 would make again

0.0	0.0	I don t normally post reviews on here but this was so good I couldn t help myself A truly 5 star dish The cookie itself is very much like shortbread so it has that trademark sandy texture and shouldn t rise or become cakey which was mentioned in another review With the glaze they are pretty rich and sweet which I personally love and the richness keeps me from eating all the cookies in one sitting The only alteration we made was instead of dipping the cookies in the glaze we spoon drizzled it over the cookies on the wire rack then smoothed with an offset spatula which worked great We were worried that with the crumbly texture of the cookies that they would break if we dipped them

0.0	0.0	I m confused by the lack of baking soda or baking powder the cookie never rose and it fell apart once baked and cooled making it impossible to salvage inro an actual cookie Disappointing because I wanted to take them to the office to share The crumbles will make a tasty yogurt topping I guess I m not wasting the ingrediemts
