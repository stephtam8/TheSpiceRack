0.0	0.0	We set out to make a gluten free stuffing that eliminates the two step process of first making cornbread then cubing and drying it to make stuffing This version has all the familiar aromatics and flavors baked right into cornbread batter resulting in a crunchy craggly super savory side dish

0.0	0.0	This was so good I used about 3 4 coarse cornmeal and 1 4 regular since that s what I had on hand For the herbs I used a combo of fresh rosemary and oregano I also added about 5 lb browned hot Italian sausage I used a 10 skillet not cast iron that was about 3 deep and cooked it for 32 minutes which created a nice crust while being set in the middle The result was hearty flavorful and delicious I will definitely make this again

0.0	0.0	Absolutely delicious I love this as a healthier gluten free option to traditional stuffing it works as a side dish alongside pretty much anything or even a main course if you re willing like me to pile it on thick on your plate I used a heap of rosemary for the herbs with significantly less thyme and it worked out perfectly Only modification I d make is to not put the whole 1 4 cup of olive oil in the pan to start with Maybe I was just using a smaller skillet than I should ve been but it was impossible for my mushrooms to crisp up with so much liquid in the pan Just enough to lightly cover the bottom of your skillet will be fine

0.0	0.0	LOVED this A few things I changed used pickled shallots instead of onions put them in right before baking instead of cooking beforehand which added some acid relief from the richness and used oat milk with lemon instead of buttermilk didn t have buttermilk I also used coarse ground cornmeal which gave such a lovely texture and crunch Great as a side dish or as a full meal depending on your vibe This will be a staple in my house

0.0	0.0	For Anonymous in LA you simply can NOT substitute Pyrex for a cast iron skillet Especially for a dish like this it will never crisp up This was wonderful and a great idea I had been using a recipe that called for me to make the cornmeal with broth polenta style then bake mixed with all the already sauteed veggies and while that is delicious this is so much more Thanksgivingy Next time I will try Anonymous in Asheville s partial substitution of corn flour Bob s GF flour

0.0	0.0	I really enjoyed this dish especially the roasted onions and kale I also liked the cornbread crust that formed where the corn bread mixture came into contact with the hot skillet My only compliant is that I wish there was more of the crispy corn bread crust I may try this recipe again with muffin tins to get more crust surface area Also I cut the ingredients in half to make 4 servings and used a 12 cast iron skillet I baked in the oven for 20 minutes rather than 25 30 minutes stated in the recipe
