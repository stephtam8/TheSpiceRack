0.0	0.0	A make ahead gravy that doesn t rely on turkey drippings or a roux The gravy s depth of flavor comes from roasted poultry bones and surprise a sprinkle of MSG which has an umami to the max effect Despite exaggerated fearmongering reports in the 70s MSG is harmless in such small quantities read more here If you have the backbone from breaking down the turkey into pieces use it in tandem with the wings See all of the Absolutely Positively Perfect Thanksgiving recipes here

0.0	0.0	Recipe name matches the results Super tasty We made a double batch and that was plenty for the meal though not quite enough to use amply with leftovers Also we used the Trader Joe s umami seasoning instead of the MSG due to food sensitivities and it turned out great We used 2 teaspoons of that but we probably should have done 3 or even 4

0.0	0.0	This gravy is insanely good and I m so glad I made it I already make really good gravy couldnt grow up in my house without knowing how to do at least that my dad is from TX The consensus at the table was it was worth every bit of effort I had made the night before I was amazed about how much it did reduce 6 cups of stock and it yielded about 3 5 3 75 cups of gravy I was concerned I wouldn t have enough but there were only 4 of us and it stretched into next days leftovers Next day I reheated some brussel sprouts using the same bowl I had just used to reheat the gravy And I commented about how they tasted even better the next day when my son observed that I had used the gravy bowl yes that was it

0.0	0.0	Now I doubled everything besides the garlic which I minced instead of cutting in half so it gave the same flavor but didn t have to use as much I only used chicken and chicken stock but made a great product in the end The only thing I would suggest is to make sure to scrape all the fat when reducing because whenever i was trying to coat the spoon and i did not do it that well the fat will make it slide off the spoon this caused me to add more of the flour and butter mixture which caused it to be a bit too thick in the end but overall great just try to get it done earlier than on the day you re eating but by far The best gravy I ever had and if you like cooking I would suggest this recipe
