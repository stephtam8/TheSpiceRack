0.0	0.0	I am sorry to disagree with Molly but for me this recipe has too many turnips I did enjoy the flavor of the sauce and the ease of assembly and cooking But the turnips for me made the flavor of the overall dish a little too one note and sweet I would have preferred a more varied mix of veg to help balance out the flavor and cut through the richness of the sauce I likely won t be making this one again
