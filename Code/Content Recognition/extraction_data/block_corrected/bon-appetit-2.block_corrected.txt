0.0	0.0	This lightly spiced chocolate cake from Yossy Arefi s book Snacking Cakes is packed with pumpkin purée and features spices often found in Mexican chocolate If you choose to use it the pinch of cayenne adds a pleasing bit of warmth You can also top the cake with 2 tablespoons granulated sugar mixed with 1 2 teaspoon ground cinnamon and another pinch of cayenne instead of the glaze If you re making a loaf cake halve the sugar spice mixture
