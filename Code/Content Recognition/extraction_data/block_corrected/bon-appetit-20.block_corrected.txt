0.0	0.0	This recipe is utter perfection My family who previously would not let me contribute pies due to the great cheesecake failure of 2006 was skeptical as I began whisking and food processing and promising that it was going to be hopefully delicious But after a night of chilling we had the pie after our Thanksgiving dinner and it was immediately requested for Christmas Thank you Adam for making my family take me seriously when saying I ll be bringing the pie

0.0	0.0	I was shocked by how much I enjoyed this recipe when I tested for my YT channel I was concerned the this wouldn t satisfy my craving for pumpkin pie due to the lighter texture That said all the great pumpkin pie flavor is there it s just a super light and airy texture that s surprisingly lovely And adding sour cream to whipped cream a total game changer I chilled mine for about 3 hours not overnight and it worked out great Next day leftover were good as well the whipped cream didn t deflate or get weird after sitting overnight in the refrigerator
