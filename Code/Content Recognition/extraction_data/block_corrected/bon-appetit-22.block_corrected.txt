0.0	0.0	This caramelized onions recipe gives you amazingly flavorful onions every single time Once you ve mastered the basic technique you ll use them for everything from French onion soup to onion dip to topping burgers		
0.0	0.0	It s key to use a large saucepan The wide base gives your onions plenty of room to cook without crowding so that the water released as they soften can evaporate if it doesn t the onions will steam rather than caramelize Another trick to get the onions to fall apart and break down fast is to slice them along their natural grain i e parallel to the axis that runs between their root and top ends

0.0	0.0	So I used this recipe w the very last bit of yellow onion I had left to use as a burger topping thus made some reductions in the amounts I added Either way it came out delicious My knife work isn t the best and I m a college student so I don t have the luxury of using any other kind of slicing tools other than my chef knife yet it still came out great Granted it probably took longer to cook down because of it lol Also I loved the tip of adding water because it cooled down the cooking of the onions w minimal effort and allowed me to continue w my mise en place for the rest of my burger toppings and whatnot 10 10

0.0	0.0	I usually start with a tablespoon of bland high heat oil and a tablespoon of unsalted butter heat until it bubbles and throw in half of the onions I do half red onions and half yellow onions in a wide flat bottomed high sided heavy pan A well seasoned cast iron pan is great Wipe pan with a little oil and bring to heat before you add the oil butter combo Just a tad above medium heat As it becomes aromatic and sizzles and begins to brown add half of remaining onions and stir to mix Wait till this batch starts to brown add a pinch of granulated sugar and mix in the remaining onions and let cook for about five minutes Give a stir and check the bottom for crusting Spread the onions to the side and drop a good size pat of unsalted butter in the center of the pan Add another pinch of sugar stir the whole thing up and turn the heat down to just above low Do not over stir at this point Here your nose is your best guide Stir when it smells dark brown but not burned Deglaze with a very hot liquid either water wine or broth I like a mix of water and red wine about 1 8 to 1 4 cup Use very hot liquid in a very hot pan swish around scrape the bottom with a spatula and pour over your caramelized onions

0.0	0.0	Every cook is different I prefer to use an oil with a higher smoke point like canola oil I start with a relatively high heat to sautee not sweat then turn the heat down when the onions are fully clarified and just starting to get crispy corners You can but don t need to add some sugar either white turbinado or brown to aid caramelization and add some new flavor It depends on what you re doing with the caramelized onions You can de glaze the pan with a light flavored white wine instead of with water I think some cooks in Louisiana use beer the ones who profess to be true Cajun chefs use only Falstaff Or that s what I hear The thing to remember caramelization happens fast but the worst part is that you get to do it over if you ruin a batch With onions less than a dollar a pound that won t kill ya unless you cook where the chef has to eat their mistakes That would be Louisiana
