0.0	0.0	The key to an excellent whiskey sour Getting the balance just right This whiskey sour recipe has all the right proportions of bright bracing lemon juice warming floral bourbon and sweet simple syrup to deliver a refreshing cocktail that s neither too cloying nor too biting Using freshly squeezed juice is essential the stuff that comes out of fruit shaped squeeze bottles doesn t even compare If you don t have any lemon on hand you can swap it out for lime or a mixture of the two Serve on the rocks with an orange wheel and a Maraschino cherry arranged neatly on a drink spear optional but recommended and enjoy Cheers
