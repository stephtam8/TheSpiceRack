0.0	0.0	We could never get tired of this roasted sweet potatoes recipe Sweet potatoes are incredibly versatile as a side dish for whatever protein you re serving or as an add on to salads so you stay satisfied for longer What s more they re easy to prepare and knock out of the park when you follow this straightforward recipe Cutting the sweet potatoes into large pieces before roasting cuts down on cook time while also allowing each piece to caramelize but stay creamy on the inside You can stick with salt and pepper but this method is a blank slate for adding other flavors too Try tossing 2 tsp ground spices such as cumin or coriander or blend such as za atar berbere or chili powder with the potatoes along with salt and pepper before sliding them into the oven
