0.0	0.0	I first had the pleasure of eating dakgalbi when I was in grade school during one of our family trips to Korea writes recipe developer David Joo While looking for a place to eat we stumbled upon a dakgalbi jjip dakgalbi restaurant The owner brought out a large skillet with all the ingredients and cooked it right in front of us Instantly I was hooked on the experience of the food being cooked at the table as well as the amazing balance of sweet salty and spicy After we had eaten about two thirds of the dish my mom exclaimed bap chuga yo which means please add rice The owner told us to stop eating and proceeded by bringing a big bowl of rice which she then fried with the remaining dakgalbi in the skillet If you have about 2 cups leftover cooked short grain white rice you can do this too Leave 1 cup dakgalbi in the pan add rice and stir fry to make fried rice Serve topped with dried seaweed and drizzled with sesame oil
