0.0	0.0	I am gluten intolerant so substituted gf flour doves farm instead of AP flour but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter The pecan brittle was delicious and worth the effort but I would say overall I was disappointed They take 2 days to make and like many other reviewers I found they spread enormously so I only baked 3 or 4 at a time and once cool they were only a few mm thick The butter flavour is quite overwhelming I had hoped the oats would balance out the richness of the butter and huge amount of sugar but I honestly couldn t even tell there were oats in there

0.0	0.0	To reinforce what others have said the recipe is time consuming best executed setting up your mise en place in advance and trusting your instincts The brittle is absolutely worth your time to make but takes longer than suggested and if it doesn t foam or spread out well at the end don t worry also I put mine in a bag and smashed it with a wine bottle rather than trying to cut it 5 cookies was also the right number for my baking sheet without them touching and 12 14 min was sufficient cook time for my oven Instead of devoting an entire 2h chunk of time to this recipe I made it in stages over an afternoon evening in between enjoying some wine with my husband and dinner prep so when it all came together at the end it was rewarding and made it feel less time consuming

0.0	0.0	I agree these cookies are fabulous and quite the adventure to make This is a long post because there were quite a few adjustments to make I too had to throw away my first attempt at the caramel for the same reason as the other reviewer and it was with a double batch Decided to try a single batch in my do over My fix was a bit different from the other reviewer and also worked just fine I mixed together the water and sugar off the heat and then added small pieces of butter before putting on the stove I cooked it over a low to medium low heat and stirred only twice to incorporate the butter once melted and once when the sugar had dissolved I used a candy thermometer to determine this and did it at 212 degrees Then I increased the heat slightly and swirled infrequently until the mixture turned dark amber This takes 16 18 minutes not 8 10 Again I used a candy thermometer and waited until it reached 330 degrees I highly recommend using a thermometer if you have one As with the other reviewer there was almost no reaction when adding the baking soda and salt However the brittle came out perfectly On baking I put 5 cookies on a pan and would not do more I used two cookie sheets and they too only took 12 minutes swapping sheets at 8 minutes Perfect After two trays I decided to divide the cookies in half For those I put 8 cookies on a tray and they took 10 minutes swapping at 6 minutes waiting for the oven to get back to 350 before putting them in The smaller cookies were equally chewy and delicious Verdict it s a bit of a project but I think I ll do it again now that I have the methodology clear One other tip Blitz the pecans in small batches to end up with less pecan dust and more pieces I sieved out the dust before using the pecans
