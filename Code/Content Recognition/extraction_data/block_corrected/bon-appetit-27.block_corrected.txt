0.0	0.0	This is the second Nan e Berenji cookie recipe that I ve tried This one is much simpler and quite frankly better than the last one I tried I used brown rice flour because that was what I had The cookies have a great flavor the cardamom really comes through They are quite delicate I had difficulty using the cookie press so I just used cookie cutters and that work fine I wasn t sure they would be sweet enough for me so I baked them with a sprinkling of cardamom laced sugar and they were definitely sweet enough
