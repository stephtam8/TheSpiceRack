0.0	0.0	I want a holiday cocktail that brings me to the pool says Tiffanie Barriere drinks educator at The Drinking Coach I m that person usually joined by all my cousins who drinks tequila at Christmas Here I make it even beachier with fresh citrus juice a little bit of red pepper jelly heat and a generous pour of crisp Mexican style lager When it comes to the beer I m all about Victoria or Pacifico but I ll let you go with whatever brand you like just as long as it s light and takes you straight to the cabana If you really can t take the heat it s not a lot you can substitute whatever marmalade or jam you d like for the pepper jelly
