0.0	0.0	My grandmother Helga and I used to make a version of this recipe together every holiday season writes Marcus Samuelsson chef of Red Rooster in Harlem New York and author of the cookbook Aquavit and the New Scandinavian Cuisine where these cookies were first published The fragrant spices in the gingersnap dough against the bitterness of the chopped candied orange peels are exactly what I want this time of the year Blanching the citrus peel in several changes of boiling water removes bitterness while still leaving plenty of bright flavor behind

0.0	0.0	The best ginger cookie recipe you will ever make I ended up doubling all the spices because I like a spicier cookie and it turned out fantastic Also it s good that the candied citrus recipe makes more than what it calls for in the recipe so you can use the candied peels for another purpose or to make the recipe again
