0.0	0.0	As a kid I spent Christmases tearing around my grandmother s house rattling dish cabinets and nerves fists full of green tinted crumb trailing buttery spritz cookies says Chris Morocco Cookies were my grandma s version of a Christmas bonus doled out to or withheld from family and friends Even after she passed away nobody dared mess with her recipes least of all the pizzette an Italian classic with fudgy texture piercing bittersweet chocolate almonds citrus zest and a heady undertone of cinnamon and clove But perhaps a bit dry A touch too much clove My first attempt at an overhaul fell flat and I scrapped it fearing angry Nonna vibes But this year I didn t hold back I made the dough more like brownie batter used butter instead of oil and took out the coffee Buttery rich and balanced who could be mad about that

0.0	0.0	I was really excited to make these but the experience was less than satisfying I printed the recipe right when it came out so I hadn t read any of the reviews but when I was trying to roll the dough it was so dry that I came to check them to see if it was just me Clearly not I really agree with other commenters Blitz the almonds and chop the chocolate Or just find a different recipe unfortunately They were basically inedible they were so dry I triple checked the instructions and weighed everything but they just didn t work The glaze helped a little with the dryness but not enough to really make me want to eat them

0.0	0.0	These are incredible I hesitated to make them after reading the reviews but I d already purchased the ingredients so why not I weighed the flour sugars and chocolate chips and carefully measured the other ingredients The dough wasn t too dry and it shaped into logs beautifully I shaped the dough on parchment paper that was printed with 1 inch grids so shaping it to the size in the directions was not too difficult I was able to use a sharp thin bladed knife to cut through the chocolate chips nuts and dough and they transferred to the baking sheet with no problems It s rare that I follow a recipe exactly but I did this time and I m pleased with the result In the future though I won t bake them as long as I did this time I didn t want to under bake them so I ended up baking them a little too long I ll also not bother to cut them on the diagonal and might shape and cut the dough so the cookies aren t quite as big as in the instructions I ve had my share of baking fiascos in the past 60 years but this wasn t one of them

0.0	0.0	The texture was alright I think they would have come out better had the cookies cooked longer or at a higher temp to get a crispier bite The flavor was also a little off If I could make it again I would just do a 1 2 tsp of cinnamon no cloves or nutmeg and more lemon and orange zest to compensate for flavor

0.0	0.0	I had high hopes here and was severely let down which feels on par for 2020 The dough was so incredibly dry it was nearly impossible to roll it into a log or properly slice them I ended up rolling the dough into mini nuggets that quite frankly resembled little poops It was hard not to laugh my way through the process I would highly recommend blitzing the almonds in a food processor or chopping as fine as possible and maybe using mini choco chips The chunky bits were a huge problem in trying to bring the dough together and slice The baked cookies are pretty dry but the glaze did help remedy that but also made them look even more like poops The flavors came together nicely but visually and texturally I dunno guys

0.0	0.0	These are my go to cookies for the holidays I would recommend really trying to cut the sizes of your nuts and chocolate down Mine weren t huge but just the average size made it a little hard to roll out to that thickness You can also just press them to the dimensions as well if you don t want to fuss with the rolling Thanks for sharing
