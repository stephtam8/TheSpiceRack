0.0	0.0	Little Debbie s chocolate marshmallow pies were my favorite packaged treat as a kid says Sohla El Waylly I d carefully separate the layers with a butter knife toast the marshmallow on a fork over the gas burner then sandwich it all back together Even as a kid I knew that desserts are better with a bit of extra toasty flavor That s why I m obsessed with these all grown up moon pies The shortbread cookies are loaded with blitzed up pretzels for that extra toastiness and salty potato chips the perfect contrast to the sticky sweet marshmallows and half dip of bitter dark chocolate The dough will look dry at first but it will come together with a bit of kneading Don t worry about overworking it with all that butter and the fat from the potato chips there isn t much opportunity for gluten to develop

0.0	0.0	These were delicious I ve made two batches now A few things measure your chips and pretzels AFTER crushing them a bit because the volume changes once they re condensed I found them slightly too salty with the salt from the chips and pretzels so I omitted it the second time totally a matter of personal preference To make the dough come together I used a large piece of parchment paper and kept flipping it over on itself pressing in the drier edges using the paper until it started to incorporate all the bits into the butter It eliminated my issues with hand kneading Let your food processor do most of the work for you the second time I made them I pulsed a few times after the dough seemed homogenous just to make it clump a bit more Also I am somewhat of an amateur with chocolate specifically and don t know how to temper it I followed the recipe as instructed initially and the chocolate did not set I m not too finicky about chocolate quality and the second time around opted to use the little wafers that are meant to harden after dipping I know the chocolate flavor isn t quite as good but I m not too picky

0.0	0.0	Something is up with this recipe or maybe the instructions We wound up with a very sticky dough that melted out on the cookie sheet even the ones that retained their butter just crumbled apart like there was nothing holding them together Please update the instructions or be more specific about the weight of pretzels and potato chips Photos of the process would help too when it is this fiddly I literally thought I had missed an entirely ingredient as binding

0.0	0.0	First of all these are delicious And the dough is seriously addictive But they are a pain to make The dough is very crumbly and difficult to work with if you have a challenging relationship with pie crust as I do this is similar Then the top cookies kept sliding off the marshmallows so I just had to sit there and keep adjusting them all until they cooled enough not to slide off All in all a very tasty treat that I won t be making again

0.0	0.0	These are really fun and delicious I just wonder if the 2 Tbsp of coconut oil in the chocolate coating is a mistake The chocolate coating firmed up nicely in the fridge but it becomes slightly tacky liquidy again at room temp making it impossible to store these at room temp as written I d definitely make them again but I d reduce the amount of oil

0.0	0.0	Made these tonight I followed the recipe almost exactly but I think I had a bigger cutter since I ended up with about 11 sandwiches instead of 18 Regardless they were amazing The marshmallows spread out easily on their own and I applied a little extra gentle pressure to the more stubborn ones I will add my dog is obsessed with the cookie dough and the cookies sans chocolate She was literally pushing me away from the counter to get crumbs of dough off the ground so definitely a use if you have extra scraps

0.0	0.0	This recipe does not work The marshmallows did not melt when the cookies were put on top I removed the Top cookies and put the bottom cookies with the marshmallows back in the oven They softened but certainly did not melt enough to cover the cookie The top cookie is not fused to the marshmallow so there is not one unified whole to dip into the chocolate Linda Giffin
