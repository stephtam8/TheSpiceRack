0.0	0.0	When I was growing up biscotti was a hard sell says Carla Lalli Music Compared with all the other holiday cookies the rock hard one that you dipped in licorice flavored liqueur was grouped under Things Adults Like That Make No Sense Now that I m grown though I ve embraced biscotti as the anti gooey chewy cookie that can be packed with my preferred dessert flavors coffee chocolate and nuts Mine come out crisp but tender and they re sturdy enough to dunk in amaro bourbon or cold milk because even in adulthood I don t understand sambuca An extra egg yolk and plenty of butter help these biscotti stay tender even after being baked twice

0.0	0.0	These are so easy to make delicious and super good with coffee The espresso powder gives them a slight bitterness that makes them not too sweet and plays nicely with the chocolate I didn t have hazelnuts so I used almonds and it worked perfectly These would be great to have on hand when people come over or for snackers around the holidays

0.0	0.0	Delicious I too cut the loaf in half lengthwise before slicing crosswise They were difficult to cut without tearing but that left the ragged ones as the cook s treat I used half coffee extract and half vanilla It s essential to use a very high quality coffee extract such as Trablit to get good results

0.0	0.0	I thought this was a delicious biscotti recipe I used a little less espresso because it was the end of the jar the one recommendation I have is when you slice them to first cut the round in half then slice in 1 2 slices They are a bit delicate Biscotti I have made in the past are much harder

0.0	0.0	I agree with other reviews that there needs to be more flavor in these biscotti I did add extra instant coffee but it didn t do much The recipe calls for vanilla but does not include it in the instructions maybe I m missing something These were fun to make but I think if I make biscotti again I will try another recipe
