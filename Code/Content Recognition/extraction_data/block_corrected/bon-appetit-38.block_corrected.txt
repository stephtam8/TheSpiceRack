0.0	0.0	Atlanta pastry chef Claudia Martinez s family has been making what Martinez describes as meaty Venezuelan tamales around the holidays for generations In the Martinez household every family member has a task Claudia s dad or grandmother always prepares the guiso the tender shredded chicken and beef stew that comprises the bulk of the filling One person slicks scoops of vibrant orange achiote stained masa dough onto banana leaves then passes them around the table to get filled Claudia s grandma adds a spoonful of guiso Claudia adds olives and capers her sister adds a few raisins Finally each hallaca gets wrapped up in the fragrant leaves and tied with twine like a tiny present ready to boil for a late Christmas Eve dinner The Martinez family usually makes 100 at a time this scaled down version of their recipe makes just under 20 enough for a big dinner plus leftovers you can freeze for another day If you find yourself with leftover masa and stew do as the Martinezes do Make arepas with guiso and fried eggs for breakfast on Christmas Day If you re in Atlanta in the days leading up to Christmas Eve pick up hallacas at Café Claudia the pop up Martinez runs out of the Hotel Clermont

0.0	0.0	Great recipe very authentic and very different from the Trinidadian version that is an adaptation of Hallacas clearly Trinidad being the chip off the mainland of Venezuela our cuisine has evolved from a few 100 years of migration of many people to our tiny island So its fantastic to finally read this version We dont tend to use sofrito in our cooking but their are so many other similarities And this dish know by the name pastelle here has always been a great family tradition Though many will not be taught this as generations change I m keen to use some aspects of this recipe going forward and say thank you to your team for another great recipe
