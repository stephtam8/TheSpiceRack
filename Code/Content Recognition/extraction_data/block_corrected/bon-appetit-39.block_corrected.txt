0.0	0.0	With crisp outsides creamy insides and a subtle sweetness from tons of blanched leeks these latkes from Zak the Baker might not be what you re used to and that s a good thing Most latkes are a lot of potato and a little bit of onion but these are nearly half blanched leeks And rather than grate raw potatoes as you might for other latkes you boil a single potato before blitzing it in a food processor along with the leeks creating a finished texture that channels mashed potatoes In place of egg almond flour binds the mixture and also adds a touch of flavor you can t put your finger on Eat these with your hands and tzatziki and head here to read about why Zak the Baker wanted to highlight them this year for Hanukkah

0.0	0.0	Delicious Keep a few things in mind so they don t fall apart Make sure not to overprocess the potatoes and leeks Then use an icecream scoop and flatten them in your palm If too liquid add some more almond flour and or breadcrumbs No more than 4 5 in the pan Fry them 4 minutes on one side then flip them I reheated them after 3 hrs in the air fryer at 360 Well worth the effort
