0.0	0.0	My new go to ramen recipe I was skeptical of the tomato paste but wow all of this comes together into a fabulous dish Followed the recipe exactly at first yum then found it could be successfully riffed in many different ways Dried ramen is fine as is chard or kale in place of the bok choy And the suggestion of adding a tablespoon or so of miso makes it even better It all comes together very quickly

0.0	0.0	Made some adjustments according to the comments like salting in between and adding miso and I definitely was happy with that The broth truly gets a little too thick but I cooked it longer so I will just add some homemade vegetable broth for my batch tomorrow Really simple a little time consuming but worth it for a simple version of Ramen Will also add less ginger next time

0.0	0.0	The recipe is good but would be better with some additional umami flavor like others have mentioned I m going to try it again with fish sauce It would also be helpful to know when to add the gochugaru back into the mix The recipe says to set it aside and never mentions it again

0.0	0.0	This recipe provides a lovely canvas unto which you may paint your own picture A meat consumer myself I found the addition of fish sauce to bring the level of umami that the people wanted If ya got an immersion blender I would recommend using that to slurry up the mushrooms as my Ninja didn t get the job done Also WATCHOUT with the crispy garlic because it gets burnt REAL quick watch that ish like a hawk
