0.0	0.0	Great recipe Definitely use broth instead of plain water though The reviewer below me MICHAEL STECKLER doesn t know what he s talking about Any chef worth a shite knows you don t use plain water for a soup you use a broth If anything is invalid it s his opinion since he clearly doesn t even know how to cook and what a weird thing that was to say anyways

0.0	0.0	Don t skimp on this recipe It s so good and comforting I ve been to Taiwan before and this is as close as I ve gotten to a traditional Beef Noodle in the U S minus the french onion spin SO happy to have this recipe under my belt when I get a hankering for Taiwanese flavor My only suggestion is to weigh the onions rather than count on using 10 We used 10 and it was wayyyy too much and ended up using only half Next time we may add more beef as well it was so good and tender we ended up wanting more

0.0	0.0	Absolutely delicious Seems that some of the others in the comments have valid concerns but everything turned out perfectly on my end I did use only 8 cups of water for the broth rather than 12 but that was just because of the size of my pot I don t think 4 more cups would have made a huge difference in flavor

0.0	0.0	This is tasty As some other reviews have said it doesn t come out very soupy by the time you add the onions and the noodles but it s still delicious I took the onions wayyy past what the recipe said maybe about 3 hours of cooking and really liked the sweetness and depth they brought Couldn t get coriander seeds so I used about 3 4 as much ground coriander and it was totally fine

0.0	0.0	I like this recipe a lot followed it to a T it came out really good My only comment is that the broth lacks some depth on the first day I will replace at least half the water with home made beef broth next time It probably can pull more flavor depending on how much meat you use and what kind we used short ribs but it could be a deeper broth with more bones meat We made our own hand pulled noodles using a method from Red House Spice a blogger from North West China which I really recommend

0.0	0.0	We used pork instead of beef and chicken stock instead of just water I read on the comments to use less star anise so the flavor is not so overpowering I m sure this is not what Amiel had in mind while developing this recipe but in quarantine times quarantine desitions I would totally make it again
