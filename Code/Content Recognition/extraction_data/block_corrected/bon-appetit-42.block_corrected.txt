0.0	0.0	There are tons of shortcuts for chicken noodle soup but this time we re not cutting corners this is the long game This version is about as classic and as comforting as they come using a whole chicken bones skin and all to lend flavor and body to the broth The key is to treat the breasts and legs differently The breasts need to be pulled early so they don t overcook and dry out whereas the legs require a long simmer to become incredibly tender We used ditalini here but feel free to use any small quick cooking pasta you have We wouldn t be mad about orzo or ABCs either
