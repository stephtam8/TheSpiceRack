0.0	0.0	Finally an easy cheesy vegetarian lasagna recipe that doesn t require you to dirty every pot and pan in your kitchen But that s not all It also comes together in just over an hour and thanks to all that frozen spinach delivers enough veggie goodness to justify eating a big pan of baked pasta on a Tuesday If you don t have a cast iron skillet don t sweat any sturdy similarly sized pan that has a heatproof handle will work almost as well here

0.0	0.0	This came out absolutely delicious Don t hate me I added meat I cooked up a lb of grass fed ground beef with the onions and garlic in the beginning Also don t hate me I used a jar of tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatoes Raos I think my jar was 32 oz so it was actually slightly too little there are 3 14 5oz cans crushed tomatoes called for and it still came out fine This was my first attempt at lasagna and I would definitely do this recipe again I d make the veg version and I d also do a version with Italian sausage Oh And I used fresh spinach that I sautéed and then used paper towels and a heavy water pitcher on top to press the water out of instead of frozen bc I had spinach to use up and that worked out great Thanks Basically always enjoy your recipes

0.0	0.0	This lasagna is full of great flavor the sauce is amazing and it does not take long to make at all I used San Marzano crushed tomatoes and they made for a delicious sauce I cooked my sauce in a dutch oven and assembled the lasagna in a glass baking dish because I do not own any cast iron and it turned out great This is an easy peasy recipe that I will make again and again

0.0	0.0	This is such a good basic vegetable lasagna recipe No frills and takes significantly less time than a classic lasagna I will admit the million comments warning against tomatoes in cast iron made me wary but since my cast iron is well seasoned there were no problems I think if your cast iron skillet is not seasoned well enough to make this recipe you should consider re seasoning your skillet for the sake of everything you make in it

0.0	0.0	Why on earth use canned tomatoes Its SO EASY AND QUICK to simply pour boiling water on fresh ripe tomatoes whose skin has been slit Then you rinse them under cold water and the skin comes off easy Takes about 15 seconds per tomato Then all you have to do is cut them and use them as required in the recipe Believe me the taste is better and sweeter than any tinned product without the industrial after taste Worth the slight effort

0.0	0.0	Really good fast and basic veggie recipe I love the ricotta spinach mixture it s like eating spinach dip in pasta It s especially good with homemade ricotta I also used some of those kinda scary no cook lasagna noodles which worked out well I think they soak up some of the excess moisture in the tomato sauce but would ve been better in a rectangle dish I think if your cast iron is seasoned and oiled well enough it s not a problem mine is still in great shape Looking forward to leftovers for my lunches this week

0.0	0.0	So all the other comments had me scared to cook it in cast iron so I made the sauce in a nonstick skillet and assembled and baked the lasagna in a 13x9 ceramic dish I ended up needing one extra noodle so I would recommend boiling a couple extra If you have the room I recommend pulling the noodles out of the cooking water individually and laying them flat on some sheet pans because if you drain them into a colander they noodles will take on weird non flat shapes that aren t conducive to lasagna Overall very good vegetarian recipe

0.0	0.0	This is your basic spinach lasagne recipe which is always good I used half cottage cheese half ricotta and Aleppo in place of black pepper While my cast iron skillet occasionally attains the state of seasoning acceptable for cooking tomatoes in it is prone to seasoning recidivism in my house so I never cook tomatoes in it The tomatoes impart a metallic taste to the food I grew up with this taste from my mother s cooking Drives me nuts to see photos of shakshuka cooked in cast iron and while I m at it cooks using metal utensils in porcelain lined cast iron cocottes I ruined my first one this way

0.0	0.0	As long as your pan is properly seasoned the acidity of the tomatoes should damage the pan and leach too much iron Just dont make it in aluminum that would truly be bad Some people actually swear by cast iron with anemia for the very small amount of iron that can be obtained
