0.0	0.0	I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the amount of salt to one teaspoon Even that seemed like a little too much Even so the ragu was delicious I simply buttered the bread before broiling though I m sure garlic butter would have been great I would suggest starting with 1 2 teaspoon of salt and adding more as you taste throughout A great weeknight meal that my family loved

0.0	0.0	Delicious I made a vegetarian version using Beyond Meat sausage that worked perfectly Also used kale instead of spinach Served with a salad and homemade Italian dressing I used a fraction of the salt as others have cautioned and it turned out perfectly This one s going into rotation in our household for sure

0.0	0.0	Great week night recipe super easy but BEWARE THE SALT I used less than what was in the recipe and it was so incredibly salty that I had to add more liquid and tomatoes to try to dilute the salt ratio I would add very little and to taste and judge by your own comfort level
