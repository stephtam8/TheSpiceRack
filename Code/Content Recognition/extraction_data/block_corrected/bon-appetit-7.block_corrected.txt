0.015384615384615385	0.0	A great simple recipe focusing on pantry staples I had larger cans of chickpeas and in my case diced tomatoes so I went with a double recipe reducing the water somewhat as the tomato volume was more than double the recipe As some had suggested I mashed some of the chickpeas to the sauteed onion mixture to thicken the dish a bit before adding the rest of the chickpeas and the tomatoes I didn t have any fresh rosemary on hand so I used fresh basil with the parsley at the end along with the Parmesan Like many simple recipes it benefits from generous seasoning with salt and freshly ground pepper And if it still isn t to your taste add more cheese and fresh herbs A great quick meal	with Parmesan

0.0	0.0	Ok this is delish But In the video Andy fries the chickpeas a bit in the onion and garlic before he dumps the tomatoes I followed the recipe and then realized I wanted to do that step Getting the color and little crisp on the beans I think would have improved it
