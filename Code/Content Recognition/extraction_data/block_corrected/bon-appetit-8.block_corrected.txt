0.0	0.0	I followed the recipe exactly without the anchovies or olives and it was still outstanding will make again The only modification I had was that I caramelized the tomatoes and onions for much longer maybe 30 40 minutes I loved the crispy fideo tops and soft stew y bottom Very rich and bold in flavor

0.0	0.0	I really liked this recipe BUT I wish I would have used regular paprika I do not like smokey flavors typically and the smokiness of the paprika totally ruined the dish for me Otherwise it was excellent I will definitely make again but use normal paprika If you are sensitive to smokiness use regular paprika

0.0	0.0	Love love love this recipe Have twice made this unique smoky comforting dish that elevates chicken thighs to a new planet Killer Followed the recipe without addition or subtraction Had a long haul flight overseas in between the first and second attempt and couldn t get it out of my mind Garlic anchovies tomato paprika schmaltz creates an awesome flavorful layered punch enhanced with the kale and the texture of the crunchy crust of the pasta edge and the crispy chicken skin Mind blown Thank you

0.0	0.0	The flavors in this were SO good I ve never made anything like this before and I had no clue what to expect but it blew my mind Next time though I will 100 use a food processor instead of grating the onions and garlic and I d probably cut down on the salt a bit Also I d probably add more kale as well I m really looking forward to making this again

0.0	0.0	This is a recipe I d typically never look twice at but I had most of the ingredients on hand and wanted to use them up I had NO IDEA what I d been missing This is so good Even with an obnoxious amount of substitutions on my end curly kale brown rice pasta omitted olives It s like a hearty pasta without being too heavy I love the healthy amounts of kale and onion and the chicken thighs are life changing Salty and shatter crisp skin The noodles absorb so much of that sofritto flavor from the garlic and anchovy and tomato paste but the edges get crispety crunchety thanks for the phrasing Rappo It does require being pretty attentive to each stage of cooking but I eyeballed a lot of the amounts and it came out great
