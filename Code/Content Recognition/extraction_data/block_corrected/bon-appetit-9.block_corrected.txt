0.0	0.0	These flavors and proportions of spice did not make a whole lot of sense together to my palate I found the amount of whole spices much too heavy The strength of the spices also did not seem a good match with delicate flaky white fish The sweetness of corn the saving grace of the dish was also mostly overpowered I made a side of basmati rice and it diffused it somewhat Some nice elements but not a happy marriage overall
