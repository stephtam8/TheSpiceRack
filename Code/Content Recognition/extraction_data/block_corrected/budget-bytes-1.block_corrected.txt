0.0	0.0	There s nothing quite as comforting as a pot of soup simmering away on the stove top when it s cold and wintry outside The smell alone warms me from the inside out This week I was craving a simple vegetable forward soup so I whipped up this really easy Tomato Lentil Soup I ve been enjoying the leftovers for days sometimes with a grilled cheese on the side Garnished with a little fresh parsley for visual appeal		
0.0	0.0	What Does Tomato Lentil Soup Taste Like		
0.0	0.0	This soup kind of tastes like a traditional vegetable soup but with a slightly more tomato y broth plus a little earthiness from the lentils It s super hearty and comforting which is exactly what I love about a good bowl of soup in the winter		
0.0	0.0	What Kind of Lentils Should I Use		
0.0	0.0	Lentils can be confusing especially since there isn t a lot of consistency in labeling in the United States I used a basic brown lentil which has a drab brown olive color and cooks with about 20 minutes of simmering Sometimes these lentils are labeled green lentils sometimes just lentils so to be sure you have the right kind check the cooking instructions on the package It should say to simmer for about 20 minutes not 45 minutes		
0.0	0.0	I do not suggest using a red orange or yellow lentil for this soup because they break down too easily and you ll end up with something more along the lines of a lentil porridge than a lentil soup It would probably still taste good though		
0.0	0.0	How are the Leftovers		
0.0	0.0	One of the reasons I love soup is because they almost always make great leftovers and this soup is no exception The leftovers will stay good in the fridge for about 4 5 days or you can freeze it for longer storage I always suggest dividing the soup into single portions just after cooking so it cools down more quickly in the refrigerator which will give you more longevity with the leftovers Once cooled you can transfer some to the freezer for later

0.0	0.0	Here in the UK I was puzzled by your use of the term Dutch Oven I ve never understood it to be a large cast iron casserole pot but rather something used for baking over an open usually camping fire I was surprised to see what appeared when I clicked the link to Amazon com Looking at Amazon co uk what we would often call a Le Creuset after the most popular make is also labelled a Dutch Oven Who knew Anyway as someone has suggested I will try this with my slow cooker which I frequently use to make delicious beef casseroles so it should work Sounds really nice and only contains ingredients my wife will eat Thank you for your recipes I really enjoy your newsletters
