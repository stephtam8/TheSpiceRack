0.0	0.0	Thanksgiving is probably going to look a little different for a lot of us this year but we can still celebrate enjoy good food and each other s company in new and creative ways Since a lot of Thanksgiving gatherings will be a bit smaller this year I m going to take advantage of cooking less volume by adding a little more flare Maybe go for that fancy cheese Add that extra topping Cook a sauce from scratch It s all easier and more affordable when you re cooking for a smaller crowd So that s what I did with this super cheesy Loaded Cauliflower Casserole It s a rich and indulgent side dish with tons of fun toppings and a smaller batch size fit for a smaller 2020 Thanksgiving feast

0.0	0.0	Adding that extra flare is also more affordable thanks to the awesome selection at my local ALDI store They have everything I need for a traditional Thanksgiving feast plus those fun specialty ingredients that can take your meal to the next level all for unbeatable prices And their cheese selection Ah maz ing So I had a little fun with the cheese in this dish and used two different varieties of cheddar noregrets		
0.0	0.0	What Kind of Cheese is Best		
0.0	0.0	Cheddar is definitely the best choice for this Cheesy Loaded Cauliflower Casserole because it melts smoothly and has a rich and creamy flavor But you can play around with different flavors of cheddar to give the dish more flare I used Emporium Selection Vintage Selection White Cheddar from ALDI for the cheese sauce and their classic Happy Farms Mild Cheddar for the topping If you want to try something more fun they have tons of seasonal flavored cheddars like smoked cheddar hatch pepper cheddar or Cajun spice cheddar all of which would all be incredible in this casserole

0.0	0.0	What Else Can I Add		
0.0	0.0	If you want to add even more to your already loaded cauliflower casserole I have some ideas I tend to like things spicy so a few thinly sliced jalapeños would be awesome especially if coupled with a few small dollops of cooling sour cream Slices of avocado might also be nice Or if you want to take this a different direction a light drizzle of sweet and tangy BBQ sauce would be an amazing compliment to the creamy cheesy sauce		
0.0	0.0	Want to turn it into a meal casserole Add some shredded chicken or browned Italian sausage before drenching the cauliflower with sauce		
0.0	0.0	What is the Serving Size		
0.0	0.0	While I could probably easily eat half of this myself I don t think that would be a reasonable serving size considering how rich this casserole is This recipe makes about six smaller Thanksgiving sized servings serving sizes tend to shrink when you re trying to fit more items on one plate or maybe four regular weeknight dinner sized side dish servings It all depends on how many other items you re serving with your meal		
0.0	0.0	Can the Recipe be Doubled		
0.0	0.0	Yes absolutely I purposely made this a smaller batch size recipe but if you do have more mouths to feed this recipe is easily doubled As long as you use a 9 13 casserole dish so that everything is still evenly spread out the cook times should all remain the same

0.011111111111111112	0.0	I m not going to suggest that because it will need too much time in the oven to heat back up and you ll be in danger of the sauce separating I made this recipe several times during the testing phase and if it s in the oven much longer than 15 minutes the sauce breaks When you make it fresh the cauliflower and sauce are already hot when it goes in the oven so all you really need is a few more minutes to melt the cheese on top	hot

0.0	0.0	This looks delicious but I wonder what just happened to your amazing beautiful wonderful and full of guidance posts I have followed your posts for years and now find myself with a bunch of specific brands and items you are touting You have rarely done this in the past and this doesn t feel like your calling card I m in Canada and though we don t have the same standards of measurement or not nearly the same selection of products I constantly tell friends and family about your blog Please don t go the sponsored route Not sure that s what s happening here but felt I needed to voice my opinion as a truly devoted fan I literally search here daily for inspiration and many have turned into family favorites

0.0	0.0	Sponsored posts help make it possible for me to provide this website to you I m extremely picky about the brands I work with and only participate when it s a brand that I truly love and can recommend If I m already going to recommend a brand and support them which I do for ALDI frequently I m going to accept their support right back I typically only do 2 4 of these per year despite getting requests from brands on a daily basis so you can rest assured that this isn t something I take lightly or plan to do on a frequent basis

0.0	0.0	That s so funny I skimmed the ingredients list and just saw the basics bacon butter cauliflower cheeses milk flour spices salt pepper etc I didn t even pay attention to the sponsored brand names sorry I glossed over that Our family just started a low carb keto plan and all I wanted to check was how well it could be adapted which looks like is quite well I m in Canada too and long ago stopped worrying that I couldn t match the specific brand given in a recipe My local market has a great selection of international products so I ve found some brands you do recommend but it s never held me back from making many of your recipes over the years if the specific product isn t exactly the same And obviously I didn t really notice Since we don t have Appleton Farms Hickory Bacon in Canada I ll be using 4 oz of Costco s Kirkland pre cooked crumbled bacon bits cuz that s all we ever keep in the house and I know this will still turn out as scrumptious as it looks Your mentioning of a sponsor s brand that pays your bills doesn t deter me from making a great dish as long as whatever I have on hand works in the recipe And this looks like it ll be another 5 star regular rotation
