0.0	0.0	You guys Thanksgiving is right around the corner And if you ve been looking for a vegetarian or vegan main dish for Thanksgiving this one is for you And if you just want a show stopping Autumn inspired dish for any other day of the week this one is for you too This Wild Rice Stuffed Acorn Squash is is colorful flavorful full of texture and just as delicious as it is beautiful It s definitely a new favorite that I m going to be making every year going forward		
0.0	0.0	Make it Vegan		
0.0	0.0	The recipe as written below is vegetarian because it does include butter To make this recipe vegan simply swap the butter with a vegan butter substitute or your favorite cooking oil I do feel like the butter adds some extra richness because of the butter cream so a vegan butter substitute will probably be the closest flavor match		
0.0	0.0	Swap out the Wild Rice Blend		
0.0	0.0	I used Lundberg Wild Rice Blend but if that is not available in your area or you want to swap it out for other reasons it can easily be swapped out for any grain or grain mix that you like Just cook your grain according to the package directions using broth in place of water for extra flavor as I did below Then simply add the cooked grain into the recipe at the same point I added the cooked wild rice blend		
0.0	0.0	How Do You Eat Wild Rice Stuffed Acorn Squash		
0.0	0.0	Sure these stuffed acorn squash are pretty but how do you eat them Just dig in with a fork grabbing some of the baked acorn squash flesh on each forkful with the filling Think of it kind of like eating a stuffed baked potato And while acorn squash skin is edible it can be quite tough so I usually just scoop everything out of the skin and leave the shell of skin behind		
0.0	0.0	Can This Be Prepared Ahead		
0.0	0.0	You can prepare the wild rice filling ahead of time and then bake the acorn squash stuff it and finish baking the day it will be served I think it s best to roast the squash the day of instead of fully baking and assembling the day before because it will take just as long to reheat the stuffed squash in the oven as it would to just bake it fresh But you can save time by preparing the filling the day before The color of the filling may dull a bit when prepared ahead but the flavor should still be just as delicious

0.0	0.0	Good recipe My husband and I devoured the rice filling and still enjoyed the acorn squash I think you could make it either way It looks nice as accompaniment to the acorn squash or you could make the rice as a side Either way Yummy

0.0	0.0	Okay wow I just made this and my husband and I devoured it Perfect ratios on everything I thought that I would have too much of the wild rice mix for the amount of acorn squash that I had but as we ate we kept adding the leftover rice mix and it was perfect
