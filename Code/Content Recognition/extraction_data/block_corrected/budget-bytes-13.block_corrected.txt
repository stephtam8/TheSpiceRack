0.0	0.0	Here s a little quickie for you this weekend This super simple tofu stir fry is a riff off of my favorite Beef and Cabbage Stir Fry It s super fast easy filling inexpensive and endlessly customizable Keep reading to see all the possibilities for making this tofu stir fry your own		
0.0	0.0	Use any Stir Fry Sauce		
0.0	0.0	This recipe is so flexible that you can literally use any type of stir fry sauce so go with whatever you like best The stir fry sauce for the Beef and Cabbage Stir Fry which this recipe is based upon is a spicy and super simple 4 ingredient sauce but I switched it up this time and used a non spicy sauce then just added sriracha on top for heat as needed Feel free to use that original sauce something a little less sweet like the sauce used in my Ground Turkey Stir Fry a richer oyster based sauce like in my Garlic Noodles with Beef and Broccoli or even something a little sweeter like a bottled sweet chili sauce It s so flexible		
0.0	0.0	Change Up the Vegetables		
0.0	0.0	I love using bagged coleslaw mix shredded cabbage and carrots in stir fry because there s no prep involved it s filling and it s still super inexpensive I used about ½ of a 1 lb bag of mix here but you could probably even add more if you want it more vegetable heavy You can shred your own cabbage and carrots you ll want about 5 cups or even use a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables in place of or in addition to the shredded cabbage		
0.0	0.0	If using frozen vegetables I suggest adding them to the skillet before the cabbage because they ll need a little longer to cook If you are increasing the amount of vegetables you may wan to also increase the sauce and add half to the tofu and half after adding the vegetables		
0.0	0.0	Substitute the Peanuts		
0.0	0.0	If you don t like or can t have peanuts don t worry They re totally optional I love the crunchy texture they add to the dish but you can either leave them out substitute with another nut maybe cashews or almonds or add a few sesame seeds to the stir fry at the end It s up to you		
0.0	0.0	How are the Leftovers		
0.0	0.0	I m going to call the leftovers of this one subjective Haha Dishes like this will seep water as they sit in the refrigerator and the cabbage or other vegetables will soften further but that wouldn t stop me from reheating and enjoying the leftovers If you re a bit more sensitive to texture and flavor changes you may not enjoy the leftovers

0.0	0.0	So easy and delicious My boyfriend and I ate the entire dish in one dinner easy though so if you re feeding more than 2 I would double this recipe I served his over quinoa to get in some extra calories and topped it with avocado green onion sriracha and some peanuts I also made 1 1 2 times the sauce recipe because we were eating it over quinoa and it was great If you like really bold flavor maybe think about making a little extra sauce but this would be great as is too Definitely going to be a regular dinner for us So quick and lovely Great recipe
