0.0	0.0	This recipe is a hybrid between my Everyday Cornbread and these amazing Sweet Potato Corn Bread Muffins from the New York Times The NYT s addition of cinnamon and nutmeg was absolutely spot on and gave the cornbread an amazing aroma Since I had already bought some sour cream to top my chili I decided to incorporate that into the batter like this recipe from Leite s Culinaria Neither of those recipes used nearly enough sweet potato for me though so I upped mine to 1 5 cups I didn t want to waste that lovely sweet potato

0.0	0.0	This cornbread is definitely on the sweeter side as far as cornbread goes but it also has a good amount of warm aromatic spices to keep it from being too dessert like It pairs well with both sweet and savory flavors The texture is rich and thick so one piece will definitely add a lot to your meal

0.0	0.0	The subtle sweetness of this sweet potato cornbread pairs absolutely perfectly with the warm spices of a bowl of chili but I also have to say it s awesome with coffee I ve also been eating it for breakfast with a thick pat of butter and with a fried egg on the side		
0.0	0.0	How to Store the Leftovers		
0.0	0.0	Make sure you allow the cornbread to cool completely to room temperature before placing the leftover pieces in a resealable container and storing in the refrigerator This cornbread also freezes quite well I suggest wrapping each piece in plastic or waxed paper then storing all of them in an air tight freezer bag or freezer safe container You can thaw them at room temperature or with a quick zap in the microwave

0.0	0.0	We made this into muffins rather than cooking it in a skillet and it was delicious The only adjustment we had to make was reducing cooking time by about 5 minutes Will definitely make again

0.0	0.0	My wife can t have dairy What should I use as a substitute for the milk and sour cream I usually use oat milk and coconut milk or cream in recipes but don t know how those flavours would fare in cornbread

0.0	0.0	Unfortunately baking can be very finicky because it can rely on some pretty precise chemical reactions so making two major swaps like that is a bit unpredictable I d need to do some testing to see if there are any adequate non dairy substitutions before making any recommendations

0.0	0.0	I ve never actually tried to reheat the whole thing in the oven My only concern is that it would dry out or get too brown with the amount of time it would need to heat through It might be possible but I don t think I can guess without actually trying it

0.0	0.0	Okay thanks for your expertise I didn t think about the drying out part I ll make it early and then put foil over it to keep it warm for a long as possible

0.0	0.0	This is SO good The spices are absolutely perfect enough to get the flavor but not overpowering at all As another commenter suggested I did half the amount of sugar to roughly 1 4 C simply because I didn t want it to be too sweet I personally really enjoyed the sweetness level but I think if you re someone who enjoys a sweeter cornbread using the full 1 2 C would be great too I used plain Greek yogurt with a high fat content instead of sour cream because I always have that on hand Also I baked it in a round 9 cake pan because I don t have a cast iron skillet and it still turned out great

0.0	0.0	This is delicious I served it with a white bean and vegetable soup tonight The house smelled amazing while it was baking I wound up using half yellow and half white cornmeal the grocery I was in this morning did not have yellow and I didn t have enough yellow cornmeal on hand I also reduced the sugar to 1 4 cup I am from Georgia and sugar in cornbread is an abomination I was willing to let this cornbread be sweet but I didn t want it to be overly sweet I felt like I tasted the spices and the sweet potato more than sweet My son just told me the recipe was a keeper and I agree PS I also cooked my sweet potatoes in the instant pot to save myself the trouble of peeling and cubing I just scooped out what I needed from the skin

0.0	0.0	I m glad to see your comment because your tweaks are exactly what came to mind after I read the recipe Steaming the sweet potatoes in an Instant Pot will produce great results without boiling away nutrients I might even reduce the sugar even more than you did given how sweet the sweet potatoes are I usually add yogurt to my cornbread and I already have plain yogurt on hand so will sub that for the sour cream I might add chopped jalapeños to increase the savoriness
