0.0	0.0	I don t know about you but I need a good salad right about now I ve been kind of over doing the comfort foods lately and my body is like pleeeease can I have some fresh vegetables But I m still trying to enjoy these fall vibes so I whipped up this Autumn Kale and Sweet Potato Salad It meal preps well which means that every time I open my fridge there is a delicious salad staring at me ready to be eaten That helps That helps a lot P		
0.0	0.0	How Long Do the Salads Last		
0.0	0.0	Thanks to the heartiness of kale and the low moisture ingredients you can prep this salad and keep it in your fridge for about five days You can either keep the dressing separate or toss the salad in the dressing ahead of time to help soften the kale If you do toss the salad in the dressing before storage you may want to make extra dressing as some of it will be absorbed as the salad refrigerates		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use a Different Green		
0.0	0.0	Yes if you are not a fan of the texture of kale you can swap it out for spinach You might also consider trying lacinato kale which is a little bit softer than the curly kale I used You can also make this salad over finely shredded cabbage and carrots which would be similar to my Sweet Crunch Winter Salad		
0.0	0.0	What Other Dressings Can I Use		
0.0	0.0	This slightly sweet and savory Maple Tahini Dressing is by far the best match for these flavors but if you must swap it out for something else I would go with some sort of sweet vinaigrette like either a honey poppyseed apple cider or pomegranate vinaigrette honey mustard dressing or even a raspberry vinaigrette		
0.0	0.0	Swap Out the Sweet Potatoes		
0.0	0.0	If you happen to have leftover roasted winter squash of any kind butternut acorn delicata pumpkin kabocha etc you can use that in place of the sweet potatoes and still have all those fall flavors I just find sweet potatoes to be easier to source and prepare so I chose those today

0.0	0.0	I did not have tahini on hand so made an apple cider dressing that my family really liked with it Tossed the dressing with the greens before topping them with the other components		
0.0	0.0	1 Tbsp apple cider 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar 1 Tbsp olive oil 2 Tbsp stone ground Dijon mustard 2 tsp maple syrup		
0.0	0.0	The dressing I made is a standard in my house and like Beth s salad is flexible No apple cider Just reduce the mustard to 1 Tbsp this adjusts both viscosity and the sweet sharp balance Don t like or don t have maple syrup Use honey or agave nectar Have normal Dijon mustard and not stone ground Dijon or no Dijon mustard at all but just standard coarse ground mustard Fine use that it will impact the taste and texture slightly but still works		
0.0	0.0	One of the reasons that I keep coming to Beth s site for inspiration is how flexible either for personal preference or budget reasons many of her recipes are

0.0	0.0	Brilliant combination of flavors No sweet potatoes in my house but a small butternut squash did fine I toasted both the pecans and pepitas and decided to roast some diced onion and a head of garlic with the squash but saved those for another purpose I ve never cared for maple flavor so used agave syrup in the dressing which was absolutely delicious I think honey would have been another good sub for the syrup but agave has an interesting mild flavor which nearly got lost in the tahini Even so the hint of it went well with the squash and nuts Please keep fall flavors coming
