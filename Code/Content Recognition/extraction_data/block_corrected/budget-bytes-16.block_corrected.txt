0.0	0.0	Preheat the oven to 350ºF This is what your pumpkin seeds will probably look like right after they re scraped out of your pumpkin The extra bits of pumpkin are a lot easier to separate from the seeds while they re in water so let s give them a rinse first		
0.0	0.0	Place the pumpkin seeds in a colander and rinse with cool water Remove the extra bits of pumpkin flesh as you rinse the seeds Let them drain well then place them in a lint free towel and pat dry This helps them get really crispy The seeds do have a sort of slippery coating so they may not feel 100 dry		
0.0	0.0	After cleaning and drying I had about 2 5 cups of pumpkin seeds from two pumpkins Place the seeds in a bowl and add your seasoning I m using a Cajun seasoning that contains a lot of salt so I only needed to add the one ingredient 1 tsp Use your favorite seasoning and don t forget to make sure it has some salt or add some separately

0.0	0.0	I make roasted pumpkin seeds every year so great My personal favorite spicing is actually soy sauce the salty and complex flavor works so well Soy sauce EVOO a bit of white pepper is perfection But next time I will definitely try cajun seasoning that also sounds fantastic
