0.0	0.0	Potatoes au gratin are basically scalloped potatoes with cheese haha that made me think of royale with cheese So if you like scalloped potatoes and you like cheese you ll LOVE potatoes au gratin

0.0	0.0	What Kind of Cheese Can I Use		
0.0	0.0	In general you want to stick to smooth melting cheeses for potatoes au gratin and avoid hard aged cheeses that don t melt as easily like Parmesan although that would make a nice topper mixed with breadcrumbs I had some cheddar cheese on hand today that I used but Gruyere is another popular choice for potatoes au gratin		
0.0	0.0	What to Serve with Potatoes Au Gratin		
0.0	0.0	This is such a rich comforting dish that it pairs well with any roasted or baked comfort food I would pair it with something like Herb Roasted Pork Tenderloin Cheddar Cheeseburger Meatloaf or Herb Butter Chicken Thighs And of course you ll probably need some sort of vegetable to balance out all that richness so add a simple side of steamed green beans for good measure		
0.0	0.0	What Kind of Potatoes are Best		
0.0	0.0	Most people like a waxier variety for potatoes au gratin like Yukon gold or red potatoes but I m the opposite I like russet potatoes because they are starchier which helps keep the sauce nice and thick and I enjoy how soft they get when baked in the creamy sauce If you prefer a more firm slice go with Yukon gold or red potatoes

0.0	0.0	Tested this last night in a head to head with Kenji Lopez Alt s Hasselback Potato Gratin and for us Beth s recipe was the definite winner for Thanksgiving We enjoyed delightfully cooked potatoes gooey cheese and a sauce that held up much better than Kenji s recipe Changes I made used half and half instead of milk light layers of the sauce in between each layer of potato using a thicker layer and cheese at the halfway point and end as instructed Since I have a convection oven I only baked this for 30 minutes foil on and 30 minutes foil off which was perfect This dish reminds me of the boxed au gratin my mom used to make only MUCH better

0.0	0.0	Halved the recipe because I don t have a casserole dish of the right size so I baked it in a 10 cast iron pan which was the perfect size Also used gruyere for the cheese because it was what I had Baked 38 minutes with foil then 22 without and the doneness is just about perfect Could ve used a hint more salt but that s probably because I used a less salty cheese Definitely the best homemade au gratin I ve made and I hope this helps anyone else making a smaller batch

0.0	0.0	sooo good but I think maybe I used the wrong setting with my mandolin and made the slices too thick I had to bake it for an hour longer than the recipe says to get the potatoes cooked through Will definitely make this again soon with a thinner slice to test it out it goes wonderfully with a nice steak

0.0	0.0	I haven t tried that so I m not sure Sometimes you can have issues with the salt in the sauce pulling water out of the potatoes and making it watery but I m not sure if that would happen here without testing it One other thing to consider is that if it s chilled when going into the oven you may need to bake longer

0.0	0.0	I too like using russets for this dish as they absorb the sauce well and I always add plenty of onion which seems to have a natural affinity for potato dishes For a richer company version use cream or half and half for part of the milk Gruyere or Swiss are also good although I usually use cheddar not only because it tastes great but also because of the cheery bright color I ve even used smoked gouda which was delicious too A perfect recipe with tons of flexibility

0.0	0.0	Beth Budget Bytes 10 28 20 8 22 am Reply		
0.0	0.0	It just sort of enhances the creaminess and adds a slight depth of flavor Since it s such a small amount you don t detect the actual nutmeg flavor it just adds a subtle enhancement to the other flavors

0.0	0.0	I have used plain nondairy coffee creamer in other recipes calling for milk It does contain whey but no lactose to set off my stomach It works in instant au gratin boxed potatoes I need to see if it works in this recipe from scratch Nut milks may add an unwanted flavor but please give it a try report back
