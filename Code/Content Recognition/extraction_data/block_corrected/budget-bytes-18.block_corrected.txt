0.0	0.0	Pork chops are delicate flowers If you over bake them they get tough and dry so you really have to pay them some attention This is where cooking intuition comes in handy I ve provided a general estimated bake time in the recipe below but the total time needed to get the internal temperature of the pork chops up to 145ºF will vary depending on several factors The thickness of your pork chops will greatly determine how long they need to bake as will the amount of time they spent in the skillet while searing The longer they re in the skillet the less time they ll need in the oven So keep these things in mind as you cook your chops and I wish you all the most juicy and tender pork chop success		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use Boneless Pork Chops		
0.0	0.0	Yes you can achieve something similar with boneless pork chops and a slightly altered technique The recipe below is written for bone in pork chops which take longer to cook than boneless chops If using boneless chops you can shorten the bake time considerably Keep your meat thermometer handy so you can test their temperature and prevent overcooking If you re using thin boneless pork chops you may not even need to bake them after searing Simply slather the seared chops with the sauce right in the skillet and let the sauce reduce a little bit to more of a glaze consistency Either way make sure they reach an internal temperature of 145ºF		
0.0	0.0	What to Serve with Honey Mustard Pork Chops		
0.0	0.0	I served my Honey Mustard Pork Chops with some Roasted Brussels Sprouts and roasted sweet potatoes Because they cooked at different temperatures from the pork chops I cooked the vegetables first then lowered the oven s temperature before adding the pork chops Make sure the oven is all the way down to the correct temperature before baking the pork chops so you don t accidentally over cook them

0.0	0.0	You ll want four thick cut bone in pork chops for this recipe Try to get pork chops that are 3 4 to 1 inch thick The pork chops I used today are about ¾ inch thick Preheat the oven to 350ºF Use a paper towel to dry off the surface of the chops this helps them sear better then season each side with a pinch of salt and some freshly cracked pepper

0.0	0.0	I just did the Brussels sprouts while I was prepping the pork chops then when they were done I reduced the heat in the oven for the pork chops You can pop the Brussels sprouts back in the oven with the pork chops for the last 5 minutes to warm them back up again

0.0	0.0	It would probably be different since they are a difference size and it depends on whether they are bone in or boneless but unfortunately I d need to test it before offering time and temp suggestions

0.0	0.0	I love this recipe and I ve made it multiple times I am wondering if it can be adapted for a slow cooker I have thick bone in chops that need to be cooked ASAP and I am going to be gone all day tomorrow Any ideas		
0.0	0.0	Beth Budget Bytes 09 04 20 9 24 am Reply		
0.0	0.0	Hmm I m not sure how that might turn out One thing to keep in mind is that a slow cooker is a wet cooking environment and an oven is a dry cooking environment so that can affect the way flavors change caramelizing sugars etc don t happen in wet environments And I think slow cookers usually need a little more liquid in there to heat evenly

0.0	0.0	SOOO DELICIOUS I used 1 thick center cut boneless pork chops Browning took 3 minutes per side and they only needed to cook for 8 minutes in the oven to reach 145 degrees F Broiled for 3 minutes under broiler set to high I poured off and whisked the sauce leftover in the pan and served over the pork chops Seriously delicious So good so happy right now I m not even a huge fan of honey mustard and I loved these They are going in my regular rotation Don t leave the sauce in the pan the chops were okay by themselves but are restaurant quality when you serve them with the sauce
