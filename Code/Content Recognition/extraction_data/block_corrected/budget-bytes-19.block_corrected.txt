0.0	0.0	I m all about keeping my side dishes as easy as possible I want my main dish to be the star of the show and I don t want to spend tons of time or energy on something that is just being served on the side so roasted vegetables are almost always on the menu They re easy tasty and mostly hands off Since we re moving into winter vegetable season I thought I d do a quick tutorial on roasted Brussels sprouts so you can whip up this simple and delicious side dish with any of your fall or winter meals		
0.0	0.0	What do Brussels Sprouts Taste Like		
0.0	0.0	I m sure there are many of you out there who have never had a Brussels sprout before in your life so I want to describe them to you a bit first To me they taste like mini cabbages but perhaps not quite so bland What makes them fun to me is the texture The delicate tightly bound leaves just are so enjoyable to eat But they are more on the bitter end of the vegetable spectrum so if you are very sensitive to bitter flavors which some people just are genetically Brussels sprouts may not be for you		
0.0	0.0	When are Brussels Sprouts in Season		
0.0	0.0	Brussels sprouts can be on the pricier side for vegetables so it s important to take advantage of them while they re in season The season can vary a bit depending on where they re grown but they are a cold weather vegetable so you ll most likely start to see them pop up on grocery stores in the U S from October to February		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use Frozen Brussels Sprouts		
0.0	0.0	Frozen Brussels sprouts can be found for a fairly good price year round so you may be tempted to try to roast those instead of fresh Brussels sprouts While you certainly can roast a frozen Brussels sprout I find that fresh create a much better texture and flavor Frozen Brussels sprouts will be softer and a little more wet even after roasting and I find that roasted fresh Brussels sprouts have a more vibrant flavor		
0.0	0.0	How to Season Roasted Brussels Sprouts		
0.0	0.0	One thing that I love about roasted vegetables roasted Brussels sprouts included is how many different ways you can season them They re delicious with just a bit of salt and pepper or you can really go to town The recipe below uses a simple mix of salt pepper and garlic but you could also do something like steak seasoning curry powder Cajun seasoning seasoning salt like Lawry s a Garlic Herb Seasoning Everything But the Bagel Seasoning or Parmesan cheese Parmesan would go great alone or along with any of the previously listed seasoning blends
