0.0	0.0	One of my favorites Our family recipe used green bell instead of banana peppers and no cheese or Italian seasoning Mom called it Confetti Salad Warning if you make it ahead of time and put it in a tupperware like container when you take off the cover there is a strong raw cauliflower scent You might want to put it in a different bowl if company is coming This is great for picnics and it travels well
