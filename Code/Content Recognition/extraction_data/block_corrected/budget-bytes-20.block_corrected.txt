0.0	0.0	THIS is the sheet pan meal to end all sheet pan meals It s similar to some I ve made before but it is by far the easiest one yet and without sacrificing any flavor This Sheet Pan Kielbasa Potatoes and Green Beans recipe is filling tasty and as easy as it gets with only SIX simple ingredients and very little hands on time I don t know what more you could want from a dinner recipe		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use a Different Sausage		
0.0	0.0	Yes if you can not find kielbasa any sort of smoked sausage will taste delicious with this combination of ingredients It s so flexible		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use Fresh Green Beans		
0.0	0.0	I used frozen green beans for this recipe because they are already cleaned cut and blanched before freezing The blanching keeps the green beans a little more moist as they roast in the oven You can use fresh green beans if you prefer just keep in mind that they will dry out a little more while roasting than frozen green beans		
0.0	0.0	What is Steak Seasoning		
0.0	0.0	Steak seasoning is my short cut for this recipe It s a bottled spice blend sometimes called Montreal Steak Seasoning that you should be able to find at any major grocery store in the U S It s a chunky mix of salt pepper garlic red pepper and sometimes a couple other spices I love steak seasoning because that chunky grind of the spices gives the dish not only texture but these wonderful pops of flavor in every bite Don t skip it		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use Different Potatoes		
0.0	0.0	Yes Again this recipe is so flexible I used small red potatoes but you can substitute larger red potatoes or even russet potatoes if that is what you have Just make sure to cut the potatoes into one inch pieces so they roast at an even pace with everything else

0.0	0.0	Love this recipe Made it for the second time last night This time I cut the kielbasa thinner than I did the first time so as to spread it around the individual bites when eating and I m pleased with that choice Also once it s on the plate I like to drizzle with a little spicy mustard for a bit more kick

0.0	0.0	The kielbasa contains a lot of herbs and spices which adds a lot of seasoning to the overall dish It also has a higher fat content which kind of creates a sauce as it renders coating everything in a lot of flaver So while you probably can do something similar with steak tips it will probably end up quite different You also need to be careful with steak tips because they may cook a lot faster than the kielbasa
