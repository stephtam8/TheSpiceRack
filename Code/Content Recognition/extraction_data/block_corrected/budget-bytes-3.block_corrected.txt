0.0	0.0	Absolutely This chicken is great on the grill whether you have a charcoal grill gas grill or even an indoor countertop grill like a George Foreman		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use Chicken Thighs		
0.0	0.0	Yes this recipe also works great with chicken thighs and they even require a little less prep Because chicken thighs are already on the thin side and they don t over cook quite as easily you can skip filleting the thighs into two thinner pieces like you need to do with a chicken breast Simply marinate then cook on each side until browned and the chicken is cooked through

0.0	0.0	Unfortunately I m not experienced with air fryers so I can t offer that advice I really suggest doing it in a skillet though because the direct contact with the hot pan is what creates that nice caramelization You won t get that same effect with hot air in an oven

0.0	0.0	Can you bake the chicken or air Fry rather than cook in a fry pan		
0.0	0.0	Beth Budget Bytes 12 14 20 8 41 am Reply		
0.0	0.0	I don t suggest it because you won t get the same type of caramelization on the chicken that you do with the direct contact of a hot pan

0.0	0.0	I ve been using and loving this recipe since it was first posted I always cook more chicken than needed for a single meal as having some for another meal or two can be a lifesaver I typically serve with roasted veggies the night I cook it I used to do the meal prep thing but since I ve been stuck at home for months I use the rest a day or two later My husband loves it with pasta Alfredo another of the world s easiest recipes and Beth has several good versions here on the site Makes great sandwiches		
0.0	0.0	Because the lemon juice in the marinade can cook the chicken a bit if soaked too long it s not a good idea to marinate much longer than the recipe says I usually opt for an hour or two ie start marinating then prep and roast veggies making extras of those too put the chicken on the grill or in the pan about the time the veggies finish up It s terrific after 8 hrs too I started before work and it was ready to cook the minute I got home served with fast sides like rice and a green salad or steamed green veggies putting a meal on the table in 15 30 minutes We like it best grilled I can cook all of it at the same time and opt to grill some veggies too
