0.0	0.0	You can never have too many easy side dish recipes in your back pocket which is why I ve been playing around a little with mashed cauliflower Mashed cauliflower kind of exploded onto the scene as a mashed potato alternative with the rise of keto diets I think there s so much more to like about it than its carb count It s easy flexible you can flavor it with just about anything and it makes a great side to just about any meal I like this Garlic Herb Mashed Cauliflower for what it is not for what it s pretending to be		
0.0	0.0	What Does Mashed Cauliflower Taste Like		
0.0	0.0	Well it doesn t taste like mashed potatoes if you ask me Ha Cauliflower does have a fairly neutral flavor that allows a lot of different herbs and seasonings to be added without clashing but it still tastes like cauliflower The flavor is light but it still has that cruciferous aroma If you know what I mean		
0.0	0.0	The texture is also different than mashed potatoes I find mashed cauliflower to be lighter and thinner if you will For that reason I think it s really important to add a decent amount of fat to your mashed cauliflower to give it body and weight something to kind of coat your taste buds and make it feel substantial		
0.0	0.0	What Can You Add to Mashed Cauliflower		
0.0	0.0	I used a very flavorful garlic herb seasoning blend to flavor my mashed cauliflower but you could also play around with things like Cajun seasoning Everything Bagel Seasoning ranch seasoning BBQ seasoning Montreal steak seasoning or just about anything else		
0.0	0.0	As I mentioned above its really important to add a good amount of fat to your mashed cauliflower so they don t taste too thin or watery I used cream cheese because it s extra thick and helps thicken up the consistency even more You can also try sour cream Parmesan cheese or cheddar cheese		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use Frozen Cauliflower		
0.0	0.0	Yes this works really great with frozen cauliflower Using frozen cauliflower has an extra advantage because it s already chopped and partially cooked for you so making mashed cauliflower will be even faster And even better yet you can keep that frozen cauliflower on hand and make mashed cauliflower whenever you want without the risk of it going bad in the back of your fridge		
0.0	0.0	To use frozen cauliflower just boil the florets according to the package directions or until they are very tender then proceed with the recipe as written below after the boiling step		
0.0	0.0	Do I Have to Use a Food Processor		
0.0	0.0	Nope I do find that the food processor gives the creamiest fluffiest results but an immersion blender also works well You can use a manual potato masher if that s all that you have available but the results might not be quite as smooth because cauliflower is a little more fibrous

0.0	0.0	We love mashed cauliflower and I love the idea of all the herbs I am definitely going to try this I used to make it with a food processor but have found I like the texture better when I use a potato ricer I drain the cauliflower and put it through the ricer as I add it back to the pan Sometimes then I will turn the heat back on to further evaporate the excess liquid

0.0	0.0	I make mashed cauliflower a few times per month Rather than butter cream cheese I like to plain greek yogurt I also like to add the cauliflower back to the warm pot after draining to steam away any extra water before blending

0.0	0.0	Yes but it probably won t be as smooth and you ll want to make sure the cauliflower is cooked to the point of being super tender An immersion blender works even better if you have one
