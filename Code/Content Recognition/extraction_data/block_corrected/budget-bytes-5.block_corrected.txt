0.0	0.0	This was a hit I used thin sliced chicken breasts and the herb butter kept them from drying out I just did Brussels Sprouts and they were the best I ve ever had highly recommend fresh instead of frozen they charred better but also got softer I m weird about textures especially with veggies and these were perfect The cranberry glaze gave it a punch of bright flavor that elevated a really easy simple dinner to something special Thanks I think this will go in our regular rotation

0.0	0.0	I am new to sheet pan cooking and unfortunately Brussel Sprouts is literally the only vegetable I can t eat I was wondering what might be a good substitute for them for cooking time Carrots Broccoli Cauliflower are what is coming to my mind and I am wondering if I m right that one of those would work I normally would never bother you with a substitution question they must be frustrating I just have 0 reference for this type of cooking to fall back on and it looks like it s going to be a great meal		
0.0	0.0	I have two balsamic vinegars the normal cheap store stuff and the aged in barrel thick syrupy stuff from Italy Am I right that I should use the cheap store stuff for this reduction I have a feeling that the already syrupy vinegar would be too sweet

0.0	0.0	Hi Karen I think broccoli would be my second choice in place of Brussels sprouts so you still get some green color plus broccoli is really delicious when roasted And you are correct use the cheap non syrupy balsamic because it s going to reduce in the sauce

0.0	0.0	I ve had several people tell me before that they enjoy roasting frozen Brussels sprouts but you just have to be aware that they don t get as crispy as fresh Brussels sprouts because they are a lot more wet I m also not sure if they d need more time so you might have to play with it a little

0.0	0.0	Unfortunately I haven t tested the cooking time for frozen Brussels sprouts I have heard from several people in the past that they like to roast frozen Brussels sprouts you just have to keep in mind that they won t get as browned or crispy like fresh Brussels sprouts because the frozen kind are a lot more wet
