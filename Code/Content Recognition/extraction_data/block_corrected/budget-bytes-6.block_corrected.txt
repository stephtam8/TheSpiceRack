0.0	0.0	How to Freeze and Reheat		
0.0	0.0	As I mentioned in the intro I froze most of my quesadillas so I could reheat them later To freeze the quesadillas fill and fold the tortillas like you are about to toast them in the skillet but instead stack them on a plate or baking sheet with parchment between each one Transfer that to the freezer and freeze for about an hour or until they re frozen solid Once solid transfer to an air tight freezer bag for long term storage They ll probably be good for about three months		
0.0	0.0	To reheat place one of the frozen quesadillas in a skillet and heat over medium low heat Cook on each side until golden brown and crispy It s VERY important not to have the heat too high or else the tortilla will burn before the filling has time to thaw and heat through So go slow		
0.0	0.0	What is Country Sausage		
0.0	0.0	I used country sausage for these breakfast quesadillas which is a loose not in links raw sausage that is fairly mild in flavor there are hot varieties It is sometimes also called breakfast sausage although it is not sweet like a maple breakfast sausage I used this brand but there are many recipes for country sausage online if you want to make your own using ground pork

0.0	0.0	Yes I reheated one in the microwave yesterday as a matter of fact You don t get that nice crispy quesadilla shell that way it ends up being more like a breakfast burrito that is folded instead of rolled P The amount of time needed will probably depend on the strength of your microwave I usually just start with a minute and then add 30 seconds as needed until it feels hot all the way through

0.0	0.0	Delicious I saw this recipe and immediately knew I had to make it for breakfast I didn t have any sausage on hand but in the spirit of BB I subbed in the same amount of bacon that I had portioned out and stashed in the freezer earlier I also added green onions The bacon was a bit more oily than sausage would have been so I left about 1 tbsp of grease in the pan to cook the eggs in and reserved the rest in a jar		
0.0	0.0	Super tasty and filling without being too heavy and if I might add the ultimate hangover cure Lol I will be using the leftover bacon grease when I make your cheesy cauliflower and potato soup later tonight

0.0	0.0	When I moved to Austin TX in 1986 these were breakfast tacos I first encountered them on The Drag Guadeloupe St across from the UT campus where I worked Breakfast tacos were always grilled until sometime in the 90s when we started to see them as warm folded tortillas with a variety of loose fillings A favorite at our house they show up 2 4 times a month on our breakfast table Our faves are mostly vegetarian I always add potato with sauteed onion garlic and peppers and a garnish of plenty of cilantro Instead of adding the cheese to the egg I plop the lightly buttered 10 flour tortilla in the hot skillet and put the cheese directly on the tortilla so it acts as glue for 2 eggs scrambled with veggies it s pretty thick 1 of these big boys is enough for 2 persons at my house While we like sausage including chorizo bacon is good too and although I rarely use it wouldn t turn my nose up at ham
