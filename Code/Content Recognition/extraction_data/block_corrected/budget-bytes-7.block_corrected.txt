0.0	0.0	French Onion Soup is one of my favorite things to order at a restaurant I usually reserve this bowl of warm comfort for restaurants because it s a soup that takes time and patience to make But I ve come to realize that although it is a slow process it s still ridiculously simple and inexpensive so it s totally worth the effort I encourage you to make a pot of this incredible French Onion Soup on your next day off while you re relaxing with a movie or folding some laundry I think you ll be glad you did		
0.0	0.0	What is French Onion Soup		
0.0	0.0	If you ve never had the pleasure French Onion Soup is made with sweet caramelized onions beef broth and herbs The soup is usually topped with a piece of toasted bread and a generous heap of cheese which are then broiled to perfection So with every spoonful you get a piece of bread soaked with flavorful broth melty cheese and sweet savory onions It s pretty epic		
0.0	0.0	Don t Take Shortcuts with Caramelization		
0.0	0.0	It s so so so so important to properly caramelize the onions when making French Onion Soup see the step by step photos below for a visual reference The deep flavor of the caramelized onion is what gives this soup its characteristic flavor If you take shortcuts with this step it will show in the color and flavor of your soup		
0.0	0.0	Caramelizing onions especially this quantity of onions is a slow process and it takes a lot of time Like an hour or more If you stop too soon your soup will be lacking If you try to go too fast you risk burning the onions not getting that sweet jammy flavor Just go slow It s worth it		
0.0	0.0	Broth Matters		
0.0	0.0	The other key to making a really good pot of French Onion Soup is using a really flavorful broth If you know me then you know I love Better Than Bouillon so I used that to make my broth for this soup But if you have access to a really good beef stock or bone broth that would also be incredible Just make sure you use a broth that you know has good flavor		
0.0	0.0	What Else Can I Add		
0.0	0.0	I made this French Onion Soup as simple as possible while still retaining its rich flavor But if you want to go above and beyond you can try adding a couple other ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Wine Try deglazing the pot after adding the flour with about 1 2 cup wine before adding the beef broth You can use either a dry white wine or a red wine depending on whether you want your soup to have a lighter touch white wine or a richer flavor red wine		
0.0	0.0	Sweet Onions I made my soup with your average everyday yellow onions but if you want a tad more sweetness you can choose a sweet onion instead		
0.0	0.0	Brandy or Sherry A couple tablespoons of brandy or sherry added to your French Onion Soup at the end can brighten the flavors		
0.0	0.0	Garlic I didn t want to muddy the sweet delicate flavor of the onions but a lot of people do prefer to also add garlic If adding garlic mince it up good and sauté it with the caramelized onions for a minute or two just before adding the flour Garnished with fresh thyme for visual appeal Dried thyme is used in the recipe

0.0	0.0	Begin by slicing 3 lbs yellow onions into ¼ inch thick slices Add the sliced onions to a large soup pot with 2 Tbsp olive oil Cook the onions over medium heat stirring occasionally		
0.0	0.0	When the onions begin to get a little golden color after about 30 45 minutes add 2 Tbsp butter Continue to cook over medium heat stirring occasionally		
0.0	0.0	The goal is to keep cooking until the onions become deep brown in color and have a jammy texture If the bottom of the pot begins to brown faster than the onions just add a couple tablespoons of water to dissolve the browned bits off the bottom and continue to cook Do not stop when the onions are the color in the photo above There is still a ways to go		
0.0	0.0	When the onions are the color of an old penny see photo above add 3 Tbsp flour and continue to cook and stir for about two minutes The flour helps thicken the soup very slightly just giving it a little extra body		
0.0	0.0	Finally add six cups of beef broth to the pot Stir to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom		
0.0	0.0	Also add ½ tsp dried thyme one bay leaf ¼ tsp freshly cracked pepper and 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce Bring the soup up to a simmer and let it continue to simmer for about 30 minutes If you re using a lower sodium broth you ll want to taste the soup and add salt to taste after it simmers		
0.0	0.0	Toward the end of the simmer time begin to prepare the cheese toast Preheat the oven s broiler Place slices of French bread on a baking sheet I only had four soup bowls so I m only toasting four pieces right now but the soup makes about 5 servings Broil the bread for a few minutes on each side or just until it s lightly golden brown It will broil more later with the cheese		
0.0	0.0	If you have oven safe bowls portion the soup into the bowls If you do not have oven safe bowls pile the shredded cheese right onto the toasted bread on the baking sheet then broil for a few minutes more to melt the cheese Top each bowl of soup with a cheesy bread slice		
0.0	0.0	If you do have oven safe bowls place the bowls on the baking sheet and add a piece of toasted bread to each bowl then top with shredded cheese		
0.0	0.0	Return the baking sheet with the bowls of soup to the oven and broil for a few minutes more or until the cheese is melted and the bread is toasty Every broiler is a little different and they cook quickly so keep an eye on them

0.0	0.0	The beef flavor is a really big part of the classic French onion soup flavor profile so it will definitely change the flavor profile There are some brands that make vegetarian beef broths meant to closely mimic the flavor of beef broth rather than just be a vegetable broth so I would go with that if you can Also keep in mind if you re trying to make the soup vegetarian that this recipe uses Worcestershire sauce which has anchovies in it

0.0	0.0	Hmm my only guess is that the heat is not high enough so you re not getting enough evaporation to allow the caramelization
