0.0	0.0	This may be a no brainer for my cocktail aficionado friends but for those who aren t naturally cocktail savvy allow me to present these Apple Cider Mimosas which are the perfect simple daytime cocktail for Thanksgiving Chances are you have some apple cider on hand especially if you re making my Cider Roasted Turkey Breast and maybe some fresh rosemary so just pick up a bottle of sparkling wine and you re in business		
0.0	0.0	What Kind of Sparkline Wine Should I Use		
0.0	0.0	While you can use just about any sparkling wine that you have available I prefer a dry or brut sparkling wine because apple cider is already extremely sweet Since apple cider also has quite a powerful flavor it can also help mask subtle flavor differences in your wine In other words you don t have to buy anything super high quality I just used a 7 49 bottle of Tourner brut sparkling wine from ALDI And if all the varieties of sparkling wines confuse the heck out of you this article about Champagne vs Prosecco is a great place to start		
0.0	0.0	What Kind of Cider Should I Use		
0.0	0.0	Again this drink is extremely flexible I used an inexpensive cider but I think it would be really fun to use a fresh local cider if that s something that is available in your area You can also experiment with steeping the cider in some mulling spices then chilling it before making the mimosas		
0.0	0.0	Make Your Own Mix		
0.0	0.0	I kept the formula simple with a 50 50 ratio of cider to wine but as any mimosa drinker knows you can tweak that to be any ratio that you like Want a full glass of sparkling wine with just a splash of cider Go for it Want mostly cider with just a tickle of bubbles You got it This drink requires no expertise no skill just pour and drink
