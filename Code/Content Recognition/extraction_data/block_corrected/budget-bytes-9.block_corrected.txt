0.0	0.0	I have to come clean about something I ve spent more years than not actively avoiding cooking a Thanksgiving dinner Pandemic or not my boyfriend and I often eat some version of this Thanksgiving Grazing Board below instead of a full Thanksgiving dinner This grazing board is festive it s easy it s all of my most favorite foods on one tray and it pairs perfectly with wine and a day of relaxing And OMG so much easier than a full meal		
0.0	0.0	So whether you feel like you just want to skip the big meal all together or you need something to keep the hungry mouths busy while you re preparing the big meal a Thanksgiving grazing board is a great option

0.0	0.0	What Goes on a Grazing Board		
0.0	0.0	When building a grazing board I like to have items from the following categories meat cheese fruit bread dips or spreads nuts and pickled vegetables That way you have an excellent mix of sweet salty crunchy creamy acidic and maybe even spicy that can all be mixed and matched into an endless combination of delicious bites I think I just described my heaven

0.0	0.0	Thanksgiving Grazing Board Options		
0.0	0.0	For each of the categories I listed above I ll list what I used as well as some alternate ideas that stay in that Thanksgiving fall theme so you can easily build your own custom board		
0.0	0.0	Meat I used salami medallions and slices of roasted turkey Other ideas include peppered salami prosciutto honey ham genoa salami or soppressata		
0.0	0.0	Cheese I included brie smoked cheddar and aged gouda in my Thanksgiving Grazing Board You want to try to have a variety of textures and flavors Here are some other cheese options try not to choose two from any category Creamy Chevre Camembert Burrata Hard Parmesan Manchego Pecorino aged cheddar or gouda Slicing cheeses Cheddar Provolone Havarti Swiss Blue Roquefort Stilton Blue		
0.0	0.0	Fruit I included grapes and pears on my grazing board as well as a few dried apricots and dried cranberries to fill in the nooks and crannies Other fall inspired fruits could include apples pomegranates figs or satsumas		
0.0	0.0	Bread I used a variety of crackers from a variety pack to provide multiple shapes and textures on the board I also sliced up a baguette and offered that on the side since there wasn t much more room on the board for bulky pieces of bread You can use virtually any type of cracker or sliced bread for your grazing board		
0.0	0.0	Dips and Spreads I included whole berry cranberry sauce honey and Dijon mustard Other fall inspired spreads include fig jam pumpkin or apple butter whole grain mustard or spicy honey		
0.0	0.0	Nuts I used a few pecan halves that I had in my pantry to fill in the gaps on the board but candied walnuts almonds or pecans would also be a nice festive touch		
0.0	0.0	Pickled Vegetables I ran out of room to include any pickled vegetables on my tray but they really do offer a nice flavor contrast to the rest of the items and I usually try to include at least one Sweet mini gherkins would be my preference for the flavor profile of this Thanksgiving Grazing Board but a classic olive is always nice too		
0.0	0.0	Garnishes I went with a couple of mini pumpkins and rosemary sprigs for my garnish since I already had both on hand Another fun option would be to get some fake or fresh sunflowers fake leaves or fake pinecones

0.0	0.0	I was just looking at this recipe for reassurance advice since I m planning that for Christmas just the three at home family here this year I noted you mentioned that crackers are strangely expensive I have found recipes online and in various cookbooks that would work marvelously and probably only use ingredients you already have I did buy some Carr s Water Crackers happen to be a family favorite and am planning to bake some pita chips from leftover pitas in my fridge
