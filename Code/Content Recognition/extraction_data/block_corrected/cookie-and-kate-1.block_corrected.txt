0.0	0.0	Are we still baking banana bread Is that still a thing Of course it is I developed this gluten free banana bread recipe in response to one of the most common questions on my healthy banana bread recipe Can I make this with almond flour		
0.0	0.0	While my go to banana bread recipe offers other gluten free options within the post including a delicious oat flour option the almond flour answer is not as straightforward I think it took me seven tries to get this recipe just right		
0.0	0.0	This version required several modifications so I m sharing it as its own recipe today I ll also walk you through how I modified the recipe to work with almond flour which might be helpful if it s your preferred flour or you happen to have a surplus in your pantry		
0.0	0.0	This banana bread is very tender moist and decadent These qualities are natural by products of using almond flour and additional eggs to hold the bread together This bread almost reminds me of pound cake in texture and it could definitely pass as banana cake perhaps you d like to top it with cream cheese frosting		
0.0	0.0	While it s different in texture from my favorite banana bread this gluten free banana bread is awesome in its own right Like the other recipe it s easy to mix together by hand in one bowl no less It s also naturally sweetened with honey or maple syrup And I believe it qualifies as paleo as well Ready to make some		
0.0	0.0	How to Make Almond Flour Based Banana Bread		
0.0	0.0	I basically crossed my healthy banana bread recipe with the lemony almond blueberry cake in my cookbook Love Real Food page 197 Here are the changes I made and why		
0.0	0.0	Substituted the flour by measuring equal weight in grams not by volume in cups		
0.0	0.0	Almond flour is actually lighter than regular flour all purpose or whole wheat when you re measuring them in the same fashion stirred spooned into cups and leveled with a knife One cup of regular flour weighs about 125 grams whereas one cup of almond flour weighs about 92 grams I ve found that flour substitutions work out better when you keep the weight constant For example 1 3 4 cups 220 grams regular flour is the equivalent of 2 1 2 cups 230 grams close enough almond flour		
0.0	0.0	This is also true for oat flour Interestingly with almond flour I ve found that another way to keep the weight constant is to simply pack the almond flour into the measuring cups When fully packed you can use the original measurement of 1 3 4 cups		
0.0	0.0	Slightly decreased the oil		
0.0	0.0	Almonds like all nuts naturally contain some oil They contain more oil than the very small amount you ll find in whole wheat flour Fun fact all purpose flour has been stripped of all oils which is why it keeps longer		
0.0	0.0	I was able to reduce the amount of oil in this recipe slightly by dropping the oil from 1 3 cup to 1 4 cup In fact I was able to get by with as little as 2 tablespoons oil in this recipe but I love the rich texture produced by 1 4 cup		
0.0	0.0	Omitted the milk		
0.0	0.0	Regular flour absorbs far more moisture than almond flour which is hardly absorptive at all I found that I didn t need the small amount of milk 1 4 cup called for in the original recipe		
0.0	0.0	Added two extra eggs		
0.0	0.0	Eggs are absolutely key to achieving a proper rise for baked goods made with almond flour Most of my baked goods made with regular flour call for two eggs while this one requires four or the middle will be deeply sunken in and wet In fact these pictures show the bread slightly sinking in the middle but my other batches were perfectly mounded perhaps the eggs used for the photos were smaller than the eggs I had used in previous tests		
0.0	0.0	Why do you need more eggs Regular flours contain gluten which is a protein that provides structure It essentially creates a framework that fills with air pockets and stays lofty after baking Almond flour is gluten free which means that we re going to have to find structure elsewhere Real eggs are the only solution that I know of that can provide sufficient structure Do not try to make this bread with flax eggs instead you ll end up with an unappetizing pudding like situation		
0.0	0.0	Added baking powder and decreased the baking soda		
0.0	0.0	While my banana bread recipe rises beautifully with baking soda this nut flour based version needs help from both baking soda and baking powder Baking powder is double acting which means that it starts producing bubbles when mixed with liquid and produces more bubbles when it s heated		
0.0	0.0	Since we added baking powder which actually contains some baking soda we ll decrease the amount of baking soda Another reason is that baking soda is much stronger than baking powder and we simply need less when they re used together		
0.0	0.0	In summary The answer to the question Can I substitute almond flour is not so simple The good news is that I use a similar formula for many of my quick bread recipes like my pumpkin bread and zucchini bread and muffins so you can likely use this recipe as a template to adjust the others		
0.0	0.0	A Few Recipe Notes		
0.0	0.0	Almond Flour vs Almond Meal		
0.0	0.0	I ve used almond meal interchangeably with almond flour in the past but I strongly recommend using almond flour made with blanched almonds in this recipe for the best texture and flavor I used Bob s Red Mill s super fine almond flour affiliate link		
0.0	0.0	How to Measure Almond Flour		
0.0	0.0	Some of my other recipes specify packing the almond flour into the measuring cups whereas for this one you ll measure the flour as you would any other stir spoon into cups and level with a knife You can read the reasoning behind this at the beginning of the previous section		
0.0	0.0	Oil Flour Your Loaf Pan		
0.0	0.0	This is really important Generously oil and flour your loaf pan as shown in the photo above If it looks excessive you re doing it right If you don t sufficiently oil flour the pan you might have trouble removing the loaf from the pan after baking		
0.0	0.0	Let the Bread Cool at Least 30 Minutes		
0.0	0.0	Almond flour baked goods since they re gluten free are especially delicate when they re warm You ll need to let this bread cool in the pan for at least 30 minutes before you try to remove it from the pan or slice it Trust me

0.0	0.0	Notes		
0.0	0.0	Recipe adapted from my healthy banana bread which also offers gluten free options for oat flour and gluten free all purpose flour and the lemony almond blueberry cake in my cookbook Love Real Food page 197		
0.0	0.0	Change it up If you want to make this bread extra fruity you could add up to 1 cup blueberries lightly floured in almond flour so they don t sink Your bread may need up to 1 hour 10 minutes in the oven with this addition Or I suspect you could add ½ cup mix ins like chopped walnuts pecans or chocolate chips without needing to adjust the baking time		
0.0	0.0	Storage suggestions This bread is quite moist and will keep at room temperature for a couple of days in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or freeze it for up to several months slice it first if you d like to be able to grab a single serving		
0.0	0.0	Egg free vegan note I always try to offer substitution options when possible but this recipe is highly dependent upon real eggs for structure and lift I do not know of a workable alternative

0.0	0.0	Dear Kate Thank you for such a wonderful recipe Your healthy gluten free recipe competes and will probably win most of the other recipes out there for banana bread that are full of butter and made with normal flour Well done As a biochemist myself I really appreciate your scientific approach to baking and all your trials and errors to perfect a recipe Your explanations for your choices bring sense to your protocols and make them easier to follow I made the banana bread today and used Avocado oil quite neural in taste and flavor and raw blue agave instead of maple syrup a very small substitution as I had to and it came out excellent moist delicate and fragrant Thank you

0.0	0.0	Impressed with the results from this recipe as a diff one I tried prior was lackluster I do wish there was a hint more of banana yes mine were almost black prior to using so may tinker with adding bit more But overall pleased with this recipe and respect the trial and error it takes to create one Currently adjusting from regular baking butter sour cream sugar to healthier options which can be tricky Thanks for explaining more details about almond flour measuring moisture etc P s Agreed it resembles more of a pound cake Very decadent Which I prefer over fluffy drier style Also doubled the cinnamon cause I m big on flavors
