0.0	0.0	Who wants a drink It s been a long week Let s relax with an Old Fashioned one of the oldest cocktails around The Old Fashioned is for whiskey lovers certainly but it also might convince naysayers to become whiskey cocktail drinkers after all		
0.0	0.0	Like mulled wine the Old Fashioned is perfect during the holidays on chilly evenings and basically any time you find yourself sitting around a fire It s a bold dynamic drink that s a little citrusy and a little sweet		
0.0	0.0	I came up with one delicious twist on the classic recipe which also happens to be a shortcut If you ve been following this blog for a while I bet you can guess what it is		
0.0	0.0	That s right I used maple syrup instead of simple syrup Historically Old Fashioned cocktails are made with a sugar cube or simple syrup I m here to tell you that they taste better with maple syrup which complements bourbon s caramel notes and stirs in like a dream		
0.0	0.0	Back when the Old Fashioned gained popularity maple syrup was not readily accessible Lucky for us it is now I hope you ll give it a try		
0.0	0.0	Old Fashioned Cocktail Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Bourbon		
0.0	0.0	Bourbon is the principle ingredient in your Old Fashioned so choose a good one Low quality bourbons are just too harsh here		
0.0	0.0	One of the best bourbons for Old Fashioned cocktails is Four Roses It s 80 proof so it s not overpoweringly strong It s also affordable and blends beautifully into cocktails offering notes of cinnamon spice and vanilla		
0.0	0.0	Note Rye also works in Old Fashioned cocktails but I prefer bourbon s sweeter flavor to rye s astringency		
0.0	0.0	Maple Syrup		
0.0	0.0	Like I said most Old Fashioned recipes call for a sugar cube or spoonful of simple syrup Sugar is gritty simple syrup is an extra step they re both just sweet		
0.0	0.0	Real maple syrup is easy to mix into the drink and tastes wonderful We won t use much of it so the flavor is subtle		
0.0	0.0	Angostura Bitters		
0.0	0.0	Bitters are made with a blend of botanicals and just a couple of drops lend a ton of flavor and complexity to the drink You cannot go wrong with classic Angostura bitters		
0.0	0.0	Oftentimes bartenders will add another dash of bitters from a different brand so you can come up with your own combination if you d like		
0.0	0.0	Ice		
0.0	0.0	Ice cools down the drink and dilutes it a bit which mellows the sharp bite of alcohol I prefer to use extra large ice cubes that I freeze in this ice cube tray affiliate link Large ice cubes are ideal because they melt more slowly and you ll only need one per drink		
0.0	0.0	Orange Peel		
0.0	0.0	No classic Old Fashioned is complete without a twist of citrus I prefer orange to lemon but you can use either one Or use both orange and lemon peel for a combination dubbed rabbit ears		
0.0	0.0	Optional Cocktail Cherry		
0.0	0.0	A cocktail cherry is optional Splurge on a jar of Luxardo cherries for an excuse to make more whiskey drinks Try a Manhattan next		
0.0	0.0	More Bourbon Whiskey Drinks to Sip		
0.0	0.0	Like this Old Fashioned all of these cocktails are naturally sweetened with just a touch of maple syrup or honey Cinnamon Whiskey Sour Classic Hot Toddy Irish Coffee Manhattan Cocktail New York Sour

0.0	0.0	I am very new to mixing cocktails So exactly how much is a dash 1 8 teaspoon 1 4 teaspoon More or less I have no clue and depending on the ingredient there can be a vast difference in taste between 1 16 teaspoon and 1 2 teaspoon Thanks for letting me pick your brain

0.0	0.0	Hey Jamie Good question and I always try to specify quantities when possible like a drop of vanilla extract would be dangerous because it pours so quickly out of the bottle The bitters are inherently difficult to measure because they come out of the bottle in dashes I d say one dash is about 1 8th teaspoon Hope that helps
