0.0	0.0	Let s cozy up with some mulled wine Turn on some music build a fire or light some candles throw some spices and wine in a pot and embrace the holiday season It s really that simple		
0.0	0.0	I ve always associated mulled wine with holiday parties but a single batch is perfect for two to four people Mulled wine is unbelievably easy to make even on a weeknight and fills your home with holiday fragrance		
0.0	0.0	This mulled wine is for wine lovers I ve encountered a few mulled wines over the years that tasted like sweet potpourri but not this recipe It s fruity and spiced but the wine still shines through		
0.0	0.0	You just might even have all of the ingredients at home If so you re just fifteen minutes away from mulled wine Let s make some		
0.0	0.0	How to Make the Best Mulled Wine		
0.0	0.0	Follow the foolproof recipe below and your mulled wine will turn out perfectly every time Here are some key tips		
0.0	0.0	1 Choose your wine carefully		
0.0	0.0	Use an affordable bottle of Merlot Zinfandel or Garnacha You ll find more wine details in the ingredients section below		
0.0	0.0	2 Heat gently		
0.0	0.0	Resist the urge to crank up the heat on your mulled wine If your wine is steaming it s hot enough Wine is delicate Heat it too long or too high and eventually your wine will taste too spicy syrupy and almost raisin like and the alcohol will evaporate over time		
0.0	0.0	3 Go easy on the spices		
0.0	0.0	You might be surprised by how few spices we re adding but they are potent Upon first sip you might think This doesn t taste spicy enough but I promise you ll change your mind by your second glass		
0.0	0.0	Mulled Wine Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Keep in mind that these ingredients are very easily multiplied One bottle of wine will yield five drinks enough for two to four people two bottles yield 10 drinks and so on		
0.0	0.0	Red Wine		
0.0	0.0	Wine forms the backbone of this recipe so naturally your wine selection is important Some red wines that you might enjoy at room temperature will not taste so nice when heated Do not use expensive wine for mulled wine since we re adding so much to it Just choose a quality wine say 10 to 20 dollars per bottle and select the varietal carefully		
0.0	0.0	The best red wine to use for mulled wine is Merlot Zinfandel or Garnacha also called Grenache These wines are dark fruity and full bodied which means they can support all of the flavors we ll be adding Look for labels that describe the wine as jammy or with notes of vanilla		
0.0	0.0	Avoid red wines that are high in tannins or super oaky in flavor like Cabernet Sauvignon I say this as someone who generally enjoys Cabernet Sauvignon Also avoid very light red wines like Pinot Noir because they don t offer enough body to carry the spices		
0.0	0.0	Brandy		
0.0	0.0	Brandy amps up the alcohol content a bit though we aren t using much It s more for warming flavor and a little bite than anything else I used E J VSOP which is affordable and fine		
0.0	0.0	You can omit the brandy if you don t want to buy it though you may want to keep a bottle around for sangria		
0.0	0.0	Fresh Oranges		
0.0	0.0	We re going to squeeze some of the fresh orange juice into the mixture then slice the rest to make rounds Oranges are in season during the cold months so you should be able to find nice juicy oranges at the grocery store		
0.0	0.0	Buy two small oranges if you can just because smaller rounds fit better into mugs Or one large will do you just might need to slice your rounds into half moons to fit		
0.0	0.0	Whole Spices		
0.0	0.0	We ll need whole cinnamon star anise and cloves Whole spices rather than ground are absolutely key to mulled wine The good news is that whole spices keep longer than ground spices a few years even I hope you have these in your pantry already if not they re worth keeping around for spiced ginger tea or hot toddies		
0.0	0.0	Maple Syrup or Honey		
0.0	0.0	Alcohol flavor becomes more harsh when heated so we ll balance out the flavors which just a tablespoon or two of real maple syrup or honey Wine lovers will love this naturally sweetened mulled wine recipe because it is not too sweet		
0.0	0.0	I honestly can t decide whether I like maple syrup or honey better They both offer some extra flavor that plays wonderfully with the other ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Garnishes		
0.0	0.0	To make mulled wine look even more festive I love to throw a handful of fresh cranberries into the pot before serving You might also like to serve individual servings with additional orange rounds or half moons cinnamon sticks and or star anise

0.0	0.0	Cook the mulled wine in a medium heavy bottomed Dutch oven or stainless steel pot My 3 5 quart Le Creuset is large enough to accommodate several batches at once Dutch ovens are great because they retain heat well and just look so pretty when you re serving straight out of the pot		
0.0	0.0	Or warm your mulled wine in a slow cooker Simply combine all of the ingredients cover and cook on low heat until the wine is steaming hot about 30 minutes to 1 hour Once it s sufficiently warmed up reduce the heat to warm or the lowest possible setting so it doesn t get too spicy		
0.0	0.0	Serve your mulled wine with a ladle In a pinch you can use a heatproof measuring cup to scoop Place a dark tea towel on a plate to give your guests somewhere to place the ladle when it s not in use		
0.0	0.0	Lastly serve your wine in mugs Glass mugs are fun because you can see the mulled wine inside I got my pretty glass mugs from Crate and Barrel but they seem to be out of stock Here are more great options

0.0	0.0	This mulled wine is lovely on its own before meals or after dinner Here are a few snacks that would pair well with it Cranberry Crostini Naturally Sweetened Candied Pecans Peanut Butter Oat Cookies Perfect Stovetop Popcorn or Cinnamon Maple Caramel Popcorn Sweet Spicy Roasted Party Nuts
