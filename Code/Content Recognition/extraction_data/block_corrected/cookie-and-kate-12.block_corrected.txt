0.0	0.0	If you re a fan of chai lattes and turmeric you re going to love this recipe This ultra creamy golden milk is inspired by traditional Indian turmeric milk haldi doodh but it is by no means authentic		
0.0	0.0	In its most basic form haldi doodh is made with turmeric haldi stirred into milk doodh or tea Typically households will add more warming spices to the mix including ginger cinnamon and cardamom		
0.0	0.0	Indian mothers prepare turmeric milk for colds coughs and sore throats and aches and pains It s warming soothing and supports the immune system which is exactly what we all need right now		
0.0	0.0	This recipe uses cashews instead of milk which makes it lusciously thick yet dairy free and vegan Serve it warm in a mug or cold over ice		
0.0	0.0	Golden Milk Origins		
0.0	0.0	Haldi doodh is the true origin and has been served in India for centuries Golden milk became a big trend in the United States just a few years ago Turmeric was gaining traction for its anti inflammatory properties and the Western world suddenly couldn t get enough		
0.0	0.0	Fast forward to a few months ago when I was wandering through Whole Foods craving a treat I grabbed a bottle of golden milk from the chilled beverage section and fell in love This recipe is a close rendition of Pop Bottle s golden milk Now I can whip some up with pantry ingredients at any time		
0.0	0.0	How to Make This Golden Milk		
0.0	0.0	Cow s milk doesn t agree with me and store bought alternative milks are often quite watery I wanted a luxuriously creamy texture so I decided to use homemade cashew milk instead		
0.0	0.0	Cashew milk is my favorite homemade nut milk because it s easy to make and produces a deliciously thick neutral flavored milk I d say the texture is similar to whole milk or slightly creamier Cashews are soft enough to blend completely into the water so there is no straining required and no waste		
0.0	0.0	Since we ve already busted out the blender we ll just add a few more ingredients to flavor the milk Blend it all together and you re done		
0.0	0.0	An Important Blender Note		
0.0	0.0	If you have a high powered blender like a Vitamix Blendtec affiliate links or a good KitchenAid you can blend the cashews without soaking them first If you do not have full faith in your blender you ll need to soak the cashews for about 4 hours or overnight in the refrigerator They soften with time which makes them easier to blend		
0.0	0.0	If you have any trouble blending the cashews you can either let the ingredients rest in the blender for at least 30 minutes and then try again or pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer to catch any tiny cashew bits		
0.0	0.0	Golden Milk Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Turmeric shines in this recipe I added some additional warming spices that make it taste reminiscent of a chai latte I hope you enjoy it as much as I do Here s what we ll need Cashews Raw unsalted and soaked if necessary Cashews make this drink so creamy and the healthy fats found within help increase the bioavailability of turmeric Check the recipe notes for alternatives Turmeric I used ground turmeric but you can also use fresh if you d like see recipe notes for quantity Just know that fresh turmeric will stain your fingers and cutting board yellow Cinnamon A natural fit with turmeric and ginger Ginger Again I used ground ginger but you can use fresh if desired see recipe notes Cardamom A classic Indian spice cardamom is uniquely aromatic and herbal However if you don t have it at home you can skip it Black pepper Helps improve the bioavailability of curcumin which is the main active ingredient in turmeric and tastes great with the other spices Honey or maple syrup A little sweetener helps mellow the fiery spices and makes up for the natural sweetness present in dairy milk You can add a bit more to taste if desired Vanilla extract A little vanilla makes this drink taste like a treat		
0.0	0.0	Enjoy Warm or Cold		
0.0	0.0	Once blended you can warm this golden milk in a saucepan until steaming while stirring often Keep an eye on it because the texture can turn gummy if it simmers for too long You can also heat the mixture in this fun steamer until warm and frothy Just know that it won t foam up like a milk based latte		
0.0	0.0	This drink is also lovely over ice which tames the spices somewhat It s a cold creamy treat on a hot day

0.0	0.0	Make it vegan Simply use maple syrup or dates details below instead of honey		
0.0	0.0	Make it nut free Instead of the cashews and water whisk or blend the remaining ingredients into coconut milk or whole milk		
0.0	0.0	Change it up Instead of honey or maple syrup you can use 4 Medjool dates soaked in hot water for 10 minutes and pitted Instead of dried turmeric and ginger you can use 3 times the amount of fresh so 3 tablespoons fresh turmeric and 1 tablespoon fresh ginger Peel and chop or grate the turmeric and ginger before using

0.0	0.0	Hello Kate Long time subscriber and Indian mother here Love your recipes and in fact am making the grilled arugula salad tonight for dinner Just wanted to let you know and you might have already seen posts about this topic by Indians but we use turmeric sparingly One very big pot of curry would probably use half a tsp of turmeric powder This is because our bodies can react negatively my mom calls it Nanj or toxicity to excessive amounts of turmeric So when I hear of people talking about turmeric helping them detox I can t help but wonder if it a tummy upset caused by ingesting excessive amounts of turmeric When making a cup of turmeric milk I put in about 1 4 tsp and even lesser if it is for my kids Having said that though we are all built differently and people here might be able to handle that amount of turmeric Just thought I d let you know
