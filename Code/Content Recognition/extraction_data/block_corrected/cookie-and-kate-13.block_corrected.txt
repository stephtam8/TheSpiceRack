0.0	0.0	These stuffed peppers aren t the kind your mom made They re meatless and loaded with fresh flavor They re cheesy as shown yes but they re just as good without the cheese You can easily make these peppers dairy free or vegan		
0.0	0.0	Most stuffed peppers are made with Italian seasonings but I went in a different direction I was inspired to incorporate some of my favorite Mexican ingredients including pinto beans cherry tomatoes cilantro lime chili powder and cumin The filling is so tasty I could eat it as a side dish These peppers are somewhat time consuming but each element is simple to make		
0.0	0.0	The trick to making great stuffed peppers is to slice the peppers in half from the stem end down through the base Then pre roast the halves until they re tender and a bit caramelized at the sliced edges This way their flavor is condensed and their texture is just right not too crisp but not falling apart

0.0	0.0	These peppers are a great meal to prepare in advance You can get a head start by cooking the rice and prepping the peppers Or assemble them completely then cover and refrigerate for later This would be a great dish to drop off at a friend s house with baking instructions about 12 to 15 minutes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit

0.0	0.0	Notes		
0.0	0.0	Make it dairy free vegan Omit the cheese and cover the baking dish during its final stint in the oven I recommend topping the finished peppers with something creamy or saucy like guacamole cilantro hemp pesto or vegan sour cream		
0.0	0.0	Prepare in advance This dish is a bit time consuming though it s not difficult You could make the rice in advance and or prep the peppers so they are ready to pop in the oven later You could even assemble the peppers completely and refrigerate covered until you re ready to bake they will likely need a few extra minutes in the oven to warm through

0.0	0.0	Kate These were wonderful A big thank you for something new for meal times even my husband who is not vegetarian loved this one I didn t have a can of pintos so used the pressure cooker to make some from dry took nearly the same amount of time as the brown rice so you could put those on together to cook up while making the rest The fresh cilantro and lime juice were the real punch for me along with the sweetness of the preroasted red peppers YUM They gave the filling for the peppers a fantastic fresh flavor Second day left overs taste even better if that s possible Now I m looking for more ways to use this bean and rice mixture enchiladas
