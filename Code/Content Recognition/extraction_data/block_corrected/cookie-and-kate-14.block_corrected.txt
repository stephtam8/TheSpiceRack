0.0	0.0	Make this Southwestern corn chowder for a cozy dinner at home This vegetarian corn chowder recipe is fresh wholesome and delicious It s perfect for cool late summer or fall evenings when fresh corn is at its peak Or you can make it any time with frozen corn		
0.0	0.0	I wanted the corn flavor to shine and balanced its sweetness with some Southwestern spice You ll find bell pepper poblano and chili powder in this atypical chowder I promise you will not miss the bacon		
0.0	0.0	I purposefully avoided using the heavy cream that you ll find in most chowder recipes Heavy cream has a tendency to dull flavors and also makes me feel weighed down Instead I blended a bit of butter into the soup one of my favorite soup tricks and stirred in some crème fraîche or sour cream at the end These dairy ingredients offer some creaminess of course plus some tanginess that you won t get from plain cream		
0.0	0.0	You can easily make this soup dairy free or vegan if desired You ll love the end results either way

0.0	0.0	Because great corn is key to making great corn chowder		
0.0	0.0	Buy fresh corn and use it promptly Freshly harvested corn has the sweetest most delicious flavor and it loses that flavor as time goes on		
0.0	0.0	How to cut corn off the cob I find it easiest to just lay the corn down on the cutting board Slice off a strip of kernels lengthwise with a sharp knife rotate so the flat side is against the cutting board and repeat as necessary		
0.0	0.0	If you can t find fresh corn or want to save a few minutes Use frozen corn which tastes much nicer than canned corn Rinse off any frost on the kernels first then add them to the pot as directed		
0.0	0.0	Corn Chowder Serving Suggestions		
0.0	0.0	You could count a big bowl of chowder as a light meal Or serve smaller portions on the side This chowder goes well with green salads sandwiches and quesadillas and simple vegetable sides Here are a few nice options 10 Minute Quesadillas Arugula and Wild Rice Salad with Zippy Lemon Dressing Erin s Peach and Avocado Green Salad Favorite Green Salad with Apples Cranberries and Pepitas Favorite Grilled Cheese Sandwich Perfect Roasted Green Beans Quick Collard Greens

0.0	0.0	Notes		
0.0	0.0	Spice level note Some poblanos are more spicy than others If you re sensitive to spice you can omit the poblano to be on the safe side and also go easy on the chili powder If you love spice you can stir in additional chili powder to taste or you could even add a chopped jalapeño to the pot with the other peppers		
0.0	0.0	Crème fraîche or sour cream I like crème fraîche because it does not curdle when stirred into hot soup I use the Vermont Creamery brand and typically find it near the goat cheese If you prefer to use sour cream or Greek yogurt you can temper it to prevent it from curdling Simply place the sour cream or yogurt in a heat safe bowl Add a few splashes of the warm soup liquid stirring after each until the mixture is warmed through Then stir the mixture into the soup		
0.0	0.0	Make it dairy free vegan Omit the butter I ve heard from some commenters who love it without any additional creaminess Or for results closest to the soup as shown use my vegan sour cream in place of the crème fraîche it works great You might enjoy garnishing individual servings with an additional dollop of vegan sour cream on top

0.0	0.0	Hi Dianne Thank you for your comment and question My nutritional information is only an estimate and I try to get it as accurate as possible Sodium can come from the salt but also other ingredients like vegetable broth etc If you want to adjust you can omit the salt and find low no sodium ingredients I hope this helps answer it for you

0.0	0.0	I made the soup yesterday It was great I understand what you mean about the salt being in other ingredients I will use my own homemade broth next time to eliminate the salt count This time I used a low sodium variety off the shelf I made the recipe just as your instructions said My husband loved it and I froze 3 containers This recipe is a keeper

0.0	0.0	I followed the recipe closely I added carrot since I had some that needed to get used up and that was a welcome addition I also used an immersion blender to blend the soup which worked totally fine and definitely gasped in awe when I added the blended mixture back into the pot so cool Opted not to use poblano as I m not a hot pepper person and didn t want to ruin the soup for myself so I increased the amount of chili powder as I went It turned out so so good Absolutely fantastic

0.0	0.0	I think this recipe has good bones I loved being able to make it creamy without loading up on cream and it was a bright and cheerful dinner However we found it to be pretty bland and had to add quite a bit more to get that depth I was hoping for I had some bacon pieces in the freezer that needed to be used so I used that as my oil I also blended in 2 jalapenos though we like things spicy so I would do 4 if I made it again its a big recipe We also added some smoked paprika I think next time I will try adding some chipotle pepper as well
