0.0	0.0	As a vegetarian for over a decade I ve eaten quite a few veggie pizzas Truly fantastic veggie pizzas are few and far between So I combined all of the elements I ve enjoyed over the years to create my own ultimate veggie pizza pie This is the best homemade veggie pizza I ve ever had and I hope you ll say the same		
0.0	0.0	This vegetarian pizza recipe will delight vegetarians and carnivores alike It s fresh and full of flavor featuring cherry tomatoes artichoke bell pepper olives red onion and some hidden and optional baby spinach You ll find a base of rich tomato sauce and golden bubbling mozzarella underneath of course		
0.0	0.0	The trick with loaded veggie pizzas as many pizza shops seem to forget is that they require a few extra minutes in the oven to develop full flavor and structure Don t stop baking until the cheese is deeply golden in spots Otherwise you might end up with floppy pizza that doesn t live up to its true potential		
0.0	0.0	Start with my easy whole wheat pizza dough and this recipe is ready in about 45 minutes start to finish This veggie pizza is quicker and healthier than delivery		
0.0	0.0	Veggie Pizza Toppings		
0.0	0.0	This pizza starts with a base of my whole wheat pizza dough As an alternative use one pound of store bought pizza dough which you can divide by two to follow my recipe exactly or just make one large pizza that also works with store bought dough		
0.0	0.0	Then we ll add the following This recipe is truly very flexible you can skip any of them if you don t like em or don t have em Use more of one for less of another Easy		
0.0	0.0	Pizza Sauce		
0.0	0.0	You have a few options here You can use my go to pizza sauce recipe which is truly so easy Or use your favorite marinara sauce homemade or store bought		
0.0	0.0	Baby Spinach		
0.0	0.0	Layer some fresh spinach between the pizza sauce and mozzarella to sneak in some greens		
0.0	0.0	Part Skim Mozzarella		
0.0	0.0	I love part skim mozzarella here because it turns more golden and bubbly than fresh mozzarella		
0.0	0.0	Artichoke		
0.0	0.0	Canned or jarred marinated artichoke is an easy addition here I sliced my jarred quartered artichokes in half again to make bite sized wedges		
0.0	0.0	Bell Pepper		
0.0	0.0	Fresh bell pepper becomes nice and tender during the pizza s short stint in a high heat oven		
0.0	0.0	Red Onion		
0.0	0.0	Red onion mellows significantly in the oven but you omit it for sensitive palates		
0.0	0.0	Cherry Tomatoes		
0.0	0.0	Halved cherry tomatoes offer reliably sweet tomato flavor and texture		
0.0	0.0	Olives		
0.0	0.0	I particularly love Kalamata olives which become a little shriveled and condensed in flavor		
0.0	0.0	Sliced Almonds		
0.0	0.0	Ever had sliced almonds on your pizza It s a trick I ve learned from a couple of local pizzerias The almonds offer some toasty flavor and crunch I ve heard from some readers who really love this addition and a few who don t it s up to you		
0.0	0.0	Optional Garnishes		
0.0	0.0	Hot from the oven I like to top this veggie pizza with red pepper flakes fresh basil leaves and finely grated Parmesan

0.0	0.0	My husband makes homemade pizza every Friday using combinations of whole grains and some white flour Today I convinced him to try your recipe for dough and suggested toppings It was incredibly delicious Crust was perfect The best part was that we didn t have to wait for dough to rise in the bread maker He didn t preheat the pizza stones cause we weren t sure how we could transfer the pizzas onto them in the hot oven With all the moist toppings he also put the pizza on the bottom rack for a few minutes at the ens to crisp the center crust Thanks for this super recipe

0.0	0.0	This was delicious and a great way to use up extra veggies I made it pretty close to as written but I used store bought dough my moms homemade marinara sauce and I used kale vs spinach because that s what I had on hand Definitely will make again when I happen to have a similar combination of ingredients I need to use up Thanks for another great recipe
