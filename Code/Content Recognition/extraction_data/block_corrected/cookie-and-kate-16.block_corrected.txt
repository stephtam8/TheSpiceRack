0.0	0.0	Delicata squash is a lovely winter squash It s unique because its skin is so well delicate that you don t need to peel it before roasting The maple balsamic dressing arugula pomegranate and goat cheese go great with the squash of course but also with apples and pears If your oven is full try sliced fruit instead or simply roast the squash the day before

0.0	0.0	Notes		
0.0	0.0	Make it dairy free vegan Skip the feta or serve it on the side Make it nut free Use pepitas not pecans		
0.0	0.0	Storage suggestions Ideally store the salad and dressing separately and toss individual servings as needed the salad will keep well for about 3 days with this method The arugula will wilt after being exposed to the dressing but even then should keep for a day or so

0.0	0.0	Fantastic salad Delightful blend of tastes and textures I used butternut squash because I didn t see delicata at my grocery store I used half romaine because I had some I wanted to use it up I tossed the squash in chili infused olive oil so the salad had some nice heat to complement the squash and pomegranate I so love how Cookie I mean Kate s recipes are always so flexible Kate I could live on your recipes alone
