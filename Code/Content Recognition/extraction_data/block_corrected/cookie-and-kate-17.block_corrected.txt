0.0	0.0	We have a surplus of tomatoes this summer and it s glorious I dreamed up this simple tomato salad recipe to make use of the excess I simply sliced ripe tomatoes into bite sized pieces then I added some crisp red onion lots of fresh basil and drizzled it all with olive oil and good balsamic vinegar		
0.0	0.0	The end result is so delicious This salad really lets raw peak season tomatoes shine The recipe is also quite versatile so you ll never tire of it Try adding some cucumber mozzarella avocado arugula or even peaches		
0.0	0.0	Serve this tomato salad as a fresh healthy side salad to any summer meal It s best when it s freshly made so I recommend cutting the recipe in half if you re not serving a crowd		
0.0	0.0	I grew heirloom tomatoes from seed for the first time this spring It was a fun process that proved easier than expected In fact I underestimated how many of the seeds would sprout I grew so many tomato plants that we filled our family s three garden plots and passed along the extra to friends		
0.0	0.0	Strangely enough our growing tomato plants have provided a sense of continuity and hope during a tumultuous year I ll do it all again next spring but maybe leave some room for more peppers and cucumbers Or maybe I need a bigger garden plot I think I m hooked		
0.0	0.0	Tomato Salad Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Tomatoes		
0.0	0.0	Ripe tomatoes are absolutely key to making a great tomato salad In other words do not attempt to make tomato salad with subpar tomatoes It s just not worth it		
0.0	0.0	For this salad I like to use a combination of cherry or grape tomatoes sliced in half and small to medium tomatoes sliced into bite sized wedges You can use any combination of tomatoes though as long as they re good ones You ll need about 1 3 4 pounds total		
0.0	0.0	Red Onion		
0.0	0.0	Raw onion can be intense so we re going to soak our onion in ice cold water while we prepare the remaining ingredients The colder your water the more crisp your onions will become Soaking the onion is a simple and quick way to improve the overall flavor and texture of your salad		
0.0	0.0	Fresh Basil		
0.0	0.0	You can t go wrong with the combination of fresh tomatoes and bail ever If you re short on basil this salad is also nice with parsley dill and or chives		
0.0	0.0	Extra Virgin Olive Oil Thick Balsamic Vinegar		
0.0	0.0	Now s the perfect time to bust out your best olive oil and balsamic vinegar because their flavors will really shine on this salad If you re curious my go to olive oils are California Olive Ranch Everyday and Trader Joe s Kalamata		
0.0	0.0	By thick balsamic vinegar I mean a high quality aged balsamic that will drizzle nicely over the salad I love Napa Valley Naturals Grand Reserve Vinegar affiliate link make sure you get the bottle with 25 stars on it Or use store bought balsamic glaze reduction by DeLallo or Alessi You can even make your own balsamic glaze with runny balsamic check the recipe notes for details		
0.0	0.0	Salt Pepper		
0.0	0.0	If possible use Maldon flaky sea salt affiliate link Flaky salt is a finishing salt that offers a hint of crisp texture and enhances the flavor of anything underneath It s such an easy way to make a recipe seem gourmet If you don t have it use kosher salt If you don t have kosher salt use half as much table salt		
0.0	0.0	Lastly use freshly ground black pepper always Pre ground pepper is nearly flavorless and not worth the cost		
0.0	0.0	Tomato Cucumber Salad Variation		
0.0	0.0	Easy Layer some thinly sliced cucumber into this recipe for the best tomato cucumber salad you ve ever had I prefer English cucumber or Persian cucumber for their crisp texture and less bitter skin If you re using a regular garden cucumber taste a slice first if the skin is bitter peel it off before slicing the rest		
0.0	0.0	Additional Variations		
0.0	0.0	This tomato salad recipe is so versatile For a more hearty salad add some mozzarella or ripe avocado If you have arugula try adding a handful or two You could even substitute ripe peaches for some of the tomatoes The recipe below provides guidance on quantities and how to layer in these optional ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Craving more tomatoes before summer ends Below are a few of my favorite recipes featuring juicy raw tomatoes or you can browse all tomato recipes here Caprese Salad with Burrata Classic Pico de Gallo Fresh Huevos Rancheros Layered Panzanella Tomato Basil Bruschetta with Balsamic Drizzle Vegetarian BLT Sandwich

0.0	0.0	We used a yellow onion because that s what we had skipped the avocado because it was too bruised and omitted the cheese because not everyone does dairy Still turned out fantastic and didn t feel like we were missing anything

0.0	0.0	This is a traditional european recipe which is superb a firm favourite We also like sliced cucumbers on a mandolin or finely with a knife sliced red or white onions dill Yoghurt Fresh dill is best but we chop it freeze it for scattering on new potatoes with butter salads or soups Husband loves parsley so we chop freeze that as well
