0.0	0.0	Let s talk about flax eggs We re living in a strange alternate reality where flaxseed is often easier to find than actual eggs Flax eggs made simply with ground flaxseed and water are a pantry friendly substitute that just might save you a trip to the store In fact you can also make chia seed eggs using this technique if you have those on hand		
0.0	0.0	If you re vegan or have an egg allergy in your family you may be well familiar with flax eggs already I didn t invent them and I don t know who did but I ve learned a lot about them over the years		
0.0	0.0	I ve been guilty of referencing flax eggs as a substitution option without providing more detail Now I can link to this page so you ll know what the heck I m talking about Today you might learn more than you ever wanted to know		
0.0	0.0	Flax eggs work well when they re a small component in baked goods pancakes and other flour based recipes Flax eggs yield a gluey substance similar to egg whites which helps bind ingredients together They also contain some fat like real yolks do As a bonus they also offer some fiber which you won t find in real eggs		
0.0	0.0	Unfortunately flax eggs don t offer as much structural support as real eggs and they definitely don t work in egg focused recipes like scrambled eggs or frittatas		
0.0	0.0	Flax eggs are an imperfect substitute but in the right recipe they can work great		
0.0	0.0	How to Substitute Flax Eggs		
0.0	0.0	Flax eggs are easy to make as needed You can make as many eggs as you need for your baking project in one bowl		
0.0	0.0	The mixture will need 10 to 15 minutes to rest Mix it up before you get started on the rest of your baking prep That way it ll be ready to go when you need it		
0.0	0.0	Note that flaxseeds come in two colors golden or brown They work interchangeably though the darker color may impart more flavor		
0.0	0.0	Flax eggs work well in many recipes		
0.0	0.0	Flax eggs are well suited for quick breads such as banana bread and muffins as well as simple cookie recipes Flax eggs are a pretty safe bet when the recipe meets the following qualifications The recipe calls for a wheat based flour such as all purpose or whole wheat Oat flour seems to work well too The recipe is stirred together by hand no mixer required		
0.0	0.0	When possible I try to offer egg substitution suggestions in the recipe notes Here s a small selection of recipes that work well with flax eggs Banana Bread and Banana Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting Blueberry Muffins view more suitable muffins here Citrus Olive Oil Cake Monster Cookies Peanut Butter Oat Cookies		
0.0	0.0	but not all recipes		
0.0	0.0	You can t whip flax eggs to infuse them with air so they don t offer much lift to your baked goods In other words if your recipe calls for whipping whites together until fluffy like a soufflé or an angel food cake flax eggs will not be a suitable replacement Aquafaba would be a better option in these situations		
0.0	0.0	Gluten free baked goods require special consideration		
0.0	0.0	Why Gluten is a protein that provides structure Real eggs also provide structure In the absence of gluten flax eggs often struggle to make up the difference		
0.0	0.0	Fortunately flax eggs tend to work pretty well with oat flour and gluten free all purpose flour blends such as Bob s Red Mill		
0.0	0.0	Flax eggs do not work well with almond flour or other nut based flours When I was recipe testing for my cookbook I tried to substitute flax eggs in my lemony almond blueberry cake recipe page 197 I ended up with what could only be described as pudding and not in a good way		
0.0	0.0	Sometimes you can skip the eggs altogether		
0.0	0.0	Surprisingly I ve found that you can often omit eggs in pancake and waffle recipes My vegan pancakes turn out well without them and I ve successfully made these oat flour based waffles without the eggs they were just a bit more delicate		
0.0	0.0	When in doubt adding a flax egg is a safer bet than omitting the egg If you re willing to a risk you might find success without them My vegan chocolate chip cookies are egg free and you d never guess it		
0.0	0.0	Flaxseed Storage Suggestions		
0.0	0.0	Flaxseed contains good for you polyunsaturated fatty acids The only downside to this kind of fat is that it deteriorates turns rancid fairly quickly Ground flaxseed goes bad even faster than whole flaxseed since it has been cracked open and exposed to air		
0.0	0.0	To prolong the life of your flaxseed ground or whole store it in the refrigerator in an air tight container When properly stored whole flaxseed will last about one year whereas ground flaxseed will last about six months		
0.0	0.0	Always give your flaxseed a whiff before using If it smells like oil paint or a box of crayons it has gone bad and should be discarded		
0.0	0.0	How to Grind Your Own Flaxseed		
0.0	0.0	Since whole flaxseeds store better I like to grind my own flaxseed meal It s easy Just blend whole flaxseeds in a food processor for about 60 seconds or until it feels like a somewhat gritty flour when you rub it between your fingers You may be able to do this in a blender if you use a sufficient quantity but I haven t tried

0.0	0.0	How to grind flax seeds You can either start with store bought ground flaxseed Bob s Red Mill offers one or grind your own To grind your own blend at least ¼ cup in a food processor for about 1 minute or until it feels like a slightly gritty flour Store any leftover ground flax in an air tight container in the refrigerator

0.0	0.0	I ve seen flax eggs mentioned on several sites but I haven t tried it yet so I really appreciate your tutorial Years ago I read about using soy flour as an egg substitute in baked goods and I found that works very well too You just need to add a tablespoon of soy flour and a tablespoon of water for each egg your replacing I mix the soy flour in the dry ingredients and the water in with the wet and I ve never noticed any difference in the final taste or texture of the baked goods

0.0	0.0	Maybe I m just showing my age but what ever happened to using a quarter cup of applesauce in place of 1 egg Its what everyone did way back when we were terrified of fat It works great in muffins cakes and other baked goods and its affordable I m always happy to find new options and try new things I guess I m just wondering how applesauce fell out of favor

0.0	0.0	I recently made a banana bread recipe using flax eggs with almond flour and the outside was perfectly cooked but the inside was still gooey Why would the recipe call for flax egg if it typically doesn t work out well and would subbing a conventional egg prevent this problem

0.0	0.0	Hi Erin I can t speak for anyone else s recipes but I would never suggest flax eggs with purely almond flour based baked goods Substituting a conventional egg might do the trick but you might need to use several In my regular flour based banana bread recipe for example it calls for two eggs My upcoming almond flour based banana bread recipe calls for four Almond flour needs a lot of structure Anyway hope this makes sense and I ll be sharing that recipe within the next couple of weeks so it may be the solution you re looking for
