0.0	0.0	What makes this banana bread healthy This banana bread recipe is made with 100 percent whole wheat flour unlike traditional banana bread recipes that call for refined flour and lots of processed sugar This banana bread is naturally sweetened with honey or maple syrup which offer some trace nutrients that white sugar does not Lastly this recipe calls for a reasonable amount of unrefined oil rather than whole sticks of butter choose from virgin coconut oil extra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil

0.0	0.0	Recipe adapted from my honey whole wheat banana bread originally based on All Recipes Storage suggestions This bread is moist so it will keep for just two or three days at room temperature Store it in the refrigerator for five to seven days or in the freezer for up to three months or so I like to slice the bread before freezing and defrost individual slices either by letting them rest at room temperature or lightly toasting them Oil options I love coconut oil here I used unrefined coconut oil and can hardly taste it in the final product Olive oil might lend an herbal note to the muffins if you re into that I tested with California Olive Ranch s Everyday variety and couldn t even taste it Vegetable oil has a neutral flavor but the average vegetable canola oil is highly processed so I recommend using cold pressed sunflower oil or grapeseed oil if possible		
0.0	0.0	Flour alternatives In place of the whole wheat flour you can use an equal amount of all purpose flour whole wheat pastry flour spelt flour or gluten free all purpose flour blend Or substitute 2 ½ cups oat flour Make muffins Here s my banana muffin recipe Make it vegan Use maple syrup instead of honey replace the eggs with flax eggs and choose non dairy milk I used almond milk or water Make it dairy free Choose non dairy milk I used almond milk or water Make it egg free Replace the eggs with flax eggs Make it gluten free Use an equal amount of Bob s Red Mill s gluten free blend or 2 ½ cups certified gluten free oat flour Do NOT substitute coconut flour Make it lower in fat I would argue that this bread contains a healthy amount of fat but you can replace the oil with applesauce if you re following a low fat diet

0.0	0.0	Sadly this turned out kind of dry for me and I wished there was more banana in the flavor The bananas I used weren t overripe the way I like for banana bread which was no doubt the issue with the too subtle banana flavor I baked it for 45 minutes I habitually set my timer for less than recipes tell me to so I avoid over baking This was done and not at all burned but just lacked moisture

0.0	0.0	Love this recipe easy and delicious I ve made it several times and so far my favorite is using 1 and 1 4 cups organic all purpose flour and 3 4 cup flaxseed meal and for the oil I really like avocado oil As add ins I did 1 4 cup chocolate chips and 1 2 cup each walnuts and raisins I stirred all my dry ingredients together with the add ins and folded that mixture into the wet ingredients as the last step It keeps the raisins and chips nicely mixed into the bread otherwise they sink to the bottom Thanks so much for posting this recipe
