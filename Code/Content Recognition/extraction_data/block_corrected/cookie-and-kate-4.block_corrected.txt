0.0	0.0	Prepare in advance Cover and refrigerate the mixture until you re ready to bake it should keep well for up to two days Bake as directed but know that your dish may require a few extra minutes in the oven since it s starting off cold		
0.0	0.0	Change it up I love the flavors you see here but you can definitely use other vegetables in similar quantities More hardy greens like kale or chard will require a bit more cooking time Find other flavor variations on my frittata post		
0.0	0.0	Can I freeze it I don t recommend freezing leftover breakfast casserole When I defrosted my frozen slices they turned very watery and slightly rubbery If you re looking for a good egg based freezer recipe check out my breakfast burritos
