0.0	0.0	Ingredient notes I used Whole Foods 365 brand of brown rice crisps found in the cereal aisle and Guittard s 46 semisweet chocolate chips I usually love dark chocolate so I was surprised that bittersweet chocolate seemed a bit too intense here		
0.0	0.0	Make it gluten free Double check that your ingredients are certified gluten free		
0.0	0.0	Make it dairy free Use dairy free chocolate chips such as Enjoy Life brand		
0.0	0.0	Make it vegan Use dairy free chocolate chips such as Enjoy Life brand and substitute maple syrup for the honey		
0.0	0.0	Make it nut free While I haven t tried I believe you could substitute sunflower seed butter for the peanut butter and omit the pecans		
0.0	0.0	Change it up You could substitute maple syrup for the honey substitute another type of nut for the pecans or omit them altogether You could also use almond butter or even pecan butter instead of peanut butter If you love salty chocolate you could double the amount of salt provided

0.0	0.0	Well I did make some changes to accommodate my diet but it worked out wonderfully I couldn t find anything edible in the cereal section of my supermarket so I ordered puffed quinoa on Amazon instead I used 100 cacao chips and added 1 4 C of maple syrup to sweeten that up a bit The puffed quinoa smelled so good I poured some into a bowl added some strawberries and poured on some almond milk and had my first bowl of cereal in a very long time I made this dish to send to my grandchildren They are sugar addicts and I wanted to give them something sweet but without sugar This seemed to be perfect The quinoa puffs were huge so I cut them in half Next time I will just grind them up into a powdery mix so I will be able to cut them better but what I made was really really good I had two extra pieces and that s what I tasted and gave one to my husband He liked them too I will definitely make these again Mailed them to my grandkids this am We ll see if they prefer this to their sugary cereals Oh I hope so

0.0	0.0	Unfortunately my bars turned out pretty crumbly I used natural peanut butter no added oils salt or sugar and subbed maple syrup for the honey I spent a lot of time pressing them down compacting them in the pan as instructed I m wondering if it was the maple syrup since it isn t as thick as honey They were also difficult to cut and often the chocolate made the bars break when cutting I promise that I didn t saw cut them I used the Enjoy Life semi sweet chocolate chips I know they won t go to waste and my kids will eat them I was just hoping the bars would turn out like the photos They still taste really good but are a bit messy

0.0	0.0	Hi Terri I m glad they taste good sorry to hear they were tricky for you I have successfully made this recipe with maple syrup and natural peanut butter though not with the Enjoy Life chocolate chips so I m not entirely sure what to suggest next time Perhaps our measurements differed slightly Hope your next batch turns out perfectly

0.0	0.0	Love the recipe Made with my granddaughter and we sort of fudged and accidentally mixed the chocolate chips into the rice crisps and it was actually really good I also used karo syrup because I had some to use up and put pecans on top of half the cookies and not the other little ones don t appreciate the nuts like we oldsters do What a fun easy and yummy treat I will make next time with maple syrup for sure Then we couldn t wait so popped into freezer or 10 minutes and dug in What do you think would happen if I mixed a 1 4 c of whey protein or collagen protein into the melted peanut butter Might try that next time to up the protein
