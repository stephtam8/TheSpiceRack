0.0	0.0	I d like to introduce you to my new favorite cookies This peanut butter oatmeal cookie recipe yields cookies that are tender on the inside chewy around the middle and just barely crisp around the edges		
0.0	0.0	These cookies are loaded with pure peanut butter flavor They re sweet but not cloyingly so If you re a fan of my monster cookie recipe you ll enjoy these as well I can vouch that they ll be a hit with your family friends kids and coworkers		
0.0	0.0	Oats make these cookies more hearty than most In fact oats are the only structure this flourless cookie recipe needs As long as your oats are certified gluten free these cookies will be too		
0.0	0.0	These cookies are easy to make too You don t need to soften your butter first just melt it You don t need to pull out a heavy stand mixer your hand mixer or some elbow grease will work great And you ll only need one mixing bowl Winning		
0.0	0.0	More than any other merit though these peanut butter cookies are delicious They re cookies and that s what cookies should be right		
0.0	0.0	Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookie Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	This recipe is quite versatile You ll notice that different amounts are offered for some of the alternative options That s because they vary by volume and make my job more difficult but who can complain about extra cookies		
0.0	0.0	Peanut Butter		
0.0	0.0	As it turns out creamy or chunky peanut butters work I generally buy natural peanut butters and this recipe has worked with all of them		
0.0	0.0	Coconut sugar or brown sugar		
0.0	0.0	Coconut sugar is a less refined sugar with a few trace nutrients and I always try to work with natural sweeteners when possible Brown sugar works well if that s what you have on hand		
0.0	0.0	Coconut oil or butter		
0.0	0.0	Either way melt it before using I can t really taste the coconut oil but it does make the cookies taste more interesting in a hard to put your finger on kind of way That s why I chose to list coconut oil first If you want your cookies to be dairy free use coconut oil		
0.0	0.0	Eggs		
0.0	0.0	Eggs act as a binding ingredient and as a leavener which means that it helps the cookies rise Eggs are essential if you want your cookies to turn out like mine That said I ve shared some notes from readers about using flax eggs as an alternative in the recipe notes		
0.0	0.0	Baking soda		
0.0	0.0	Baking soda is another leavener that helps your cookies bake up nice and fluffy Don t substitute baking powder they behave differently Always always always use the leavener specified in the recipe		
0.0	0.0	Quick cooking or old fashioned oats		
0.0	0.0	Quick oats disappear more into the cookies creating a more uniform texture I prefer quick cooking oats so that s what you ll see in the photos Old fashioned oats offer a more hearty and discernible texture		
0.0	0.0	Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookie Variations		
0.0	0.0	Substitute other nut butters		
0.0	0.0	I m in love with how these cookies turn out with peanut butter but they ll also work with almond butter or sunflower seed butter		
0.0	0.0	Stir in some extras		
0.0	0.0	You can add up to 1 1 2 cups chocolate chips chopped nuts raisins or dried fruit		
0.0	0.0	Make bigger cookies		
0.0	0.0	This recipe yields around 27 medium cookies about 3 inches across If you double the size of each cookie to use 1 4 cup dough each you ll end up with 13 to 14 large cookies instead about 4 5 inches wide The large cookies will require somewhere between 8 to 11 minutes in the oven		
0.0	0.0	Please let me know how your cookies turn out in the comments I love hearing from you and appreciate your feedback

0.0	0.0	This is my 4th batch of these super delicious beauties Made them with flax egg and replaced 1 cup of brown sugar with 1 cup of finely chopped dates to make them even more nutritious They came out fantastic Also I was almost out of coconut oil so made up the difference with extra virgin olive oil can t tell any difference

0.0	0.0	Perhaps try using mashed banana instead of the sugar I do this often for a natural sweetener substitute as I don t like to put lots of sugar into recipes so will use this method and swap out some or all of the sugar for that instead You can do a blend of mashed banana and some apple puree which is pure apples blended but I would only do a cup worth rather than the amount mentioned above Good luck

0.0	0.0	A while back someone living on the KETO diet mentioned that he really likes Lakanto s Monkfruit sweetener blend So last month I purchased a large bag at my local Costco at a good price of course I recently substituted this blend for 1 2 the sugar called for in an old recipe I like for Ginger Pear Cake It was delicious and a fun experiment since I also substituted some Almond Flour for some of the white flour and upped the amount of pears considerably So I agree with Bridget that adding some sweet fruit might also be a good idea or maybe a puree of soaked dates Good luck
