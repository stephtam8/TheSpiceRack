0.0	0.0	What are monster cookies though I asked recently with vague recollections of cookies with M M s in them		
0.0	0.0	Peanut butter chocolate and oat cookies		
0.0	0.0	Well I m sold		
0.0	0.0	This monster cookie recipe took me about eight tries nine to get right but they are just right		
0.0	0.0	I almost gave up on them to tell you the truth My fella took a batch to work and overheard his coworker say This is the best cookie I ve ever had so I knew I was close		
0.0	0.0	Here they are in time for a fun weekend baking project or Valentine s treat Let s make some cookies		
0.0	0.0	These monster cookies are made with more wholesome ingredients than most They have a classic bakery look and taste and the sugar content that goes along with that If you re looking for lightened up lower sugar cookies check these out or just make half sized cookies		
0.0	0.0	These cookies are essentially made with peanut butter eggs coconut sugar or brown sugar melted coconut oil or butter and chocolate They re flourless and gluten free as long as your oats are certified gluten free I like to think that the nut butter and oats makes them a little more redeeming		
0.0	0.0	How to Make Monster Cookies		
0.0	0.0	These cookies are seriously easy to make with basic ingredients You don t even need to remember to soften your butter Here s the rundown Combine your peanut butter sugar and melted oil or butter in a large mixing bowl and mix well You could do this in a stand mixer but I hate lugging mine out I use my beloved hand mixer affiliate link You can also mix these cookies with a big spoon by hand which will take some muscle but it s totally doable Add eggs baking soda and vanilla Mix again This is so easy you might as well turn on some music and dance around while you re working on these Add your oats and chocolate Mix again La lalalala Scoop the dough onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet These are big cookies that expand while baking so I can fit six per half sheet pan Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until they re just starting to turn golden on the edges then let them cool while you put the next batch in the oven Repeat one more time and you re done If you re in a hurry I think you could bake two sets of six cookies at the same time with racks in the upper and bottom thirds of the oven		
0.0	0.0	Monster Cookie Ingredient Considerations		
0.0	0.0	Quick cooking oats vs old fashioned oats		
0.0	0.0	Quick oats disappear more into the cookies whereas old fashioned oats offer a more hearty and discernible texture Did you know that quick cooking and old fashioned oats have nearly identical nutrition properties Quick cooking oats are just cut up a little more		
0.0	0.0	Coconut oil and other oils vs butter		
0.0	0.0	I love using unrefined virgin coconut oil in this recipe because it lends a very subtle layer of complexity I can t really pick out the coconut flavor but the cookies taste a little more interesting You could use a mild extra virgin olive oil like California Olive Ranch Everyday or neutral oil such as sunflower seed oil but those tend to be more refined		
0.0	0.0	Butter works great too if you re going for a super classic monster cookie		
0.0	0.0	Coconut sugar vs brown sugar		
0.0	0.0	I like to use coconut sugar since it s a less refined more natural sweetener made from evaporated coconut nectar It doesn t taste like coconut it s similar to brown sugar in flavor It has been gaining popularity over the past few years I buy it at Trader Joe s or Whole Foods		
0.0	0.0	Brown sugar works too and costs less You might be wondering why the recipe calls for 2 1 2 cups coconut sugar or 2 cups brown sugar they actually are about the same by weight Coconut sugar just weighs less per cup		
0.0	0.0	Chocolate chips vs chocolate coated candies		
0.0	0.0	Most monster cookies are made with an equal mix of chocolate chips and chocolate coated candies think M M s The candies are fun because you can buy colors that match the seasons or holidays red and pink for Valentine s Day pastels for Easter red and green for Christmas multi colored for Halloween etc I bought my naturally colored candies at Whole Foods near the bulk bins		
0.0	0.0	However I also love these cookies with all chocolate chips I buy bittersweet chocolate chips so they satisfy my craving for dark chocolate that way		
0.0	0.0	Change It Up		
0.0	0.0	Mix up your mix ins		
0.0	0.0	Like I said I love these cookies with all chocolate chips no candy coated chocolate You could even substitute some chopped nuts raisins or other dried fruit for some or all of the chocolate		
0.0	0.0	Substitute other nut butters		
0.0	0.0	I can t get enough of the peanut butter version but you could substitute almond butter or sunflower seed butter		
0.0	0.0	Make smaller cookies		
0.0	0.0	This recipe yields 18 large cookies which use 1 4 cup dough each You could easily make 36 smaller cookies by using scoops of 2 tablespoons each You cookies will bake up faster somewhere between 6 to 9 minutes They re done when they re just starting to turn golden around the edges		
0.0	0.0	Please let me know how your cookies turn out in the comments They re a real treat and I hope they become your new favorite cookie recipe

0.0	0.0	Make it gluten free Be sure to use certified gluten free oats		
0.0	0.0	Make it vegan egg free Commenters report that flax eggs work fairly well you might need to press the cookies down into a cookie like shape before baking and they might need a couple more minutes in the oven To make it vegan also use coconut oil instead of butter and make sure to choose vegan chocolate chips and chocolate candies		
0.0	0.0	Make it dairy free Use coconut oil instead of butter		
0.0	0.0	Make it nut free Sunflower seed butter works well If you re only avoiding peanuts almond butter will work too
