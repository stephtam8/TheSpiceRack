0.0	0.0	Recipe adapted from my blueberry almond crisp		
0.0	0.0	How to use frozen berries Defrost the berries in the refrigerator overnight or at room temperature for about 2 hours no need to drain off excess juices Or while the oven is preheating place the frozen berries in your square baker Warm them up in the oven stirring every 10 minutes or so until they have defrosted to the point that they are cool to the touch but no longer frozen For frozen berries no need to slice before using since they are so tender already Then add the honey etc and proceed with the recipe as written		
0.0	0.0	Make it gluten free Be sure to use certified gluten free oats Make it nut free Omit the sliced almonds and use ¾ cup whole wheat flour and ¾ cup oats instead of the almond meal and oats specified above It will no longer be gluten free If you want to keep it gluten free I suspect that you could replace the almond meal with about ⅔ cup oat flour haven t tried that please comment if you do Make it vegan I believe you could use melted coconut oil in place of the browned butter yogurt use 4 tablespoons coconut oil and add up to 3 more until the topping mixture is moistened throughout and maple syrup instead of the honey I haven t tried it though What s arrowroot starch Arrowroot starch is a great thickener to use in place of corn starch which is often genetically modified It s gluten free too Look for it in the baking section of well stocked grocery stores or buy it online affiliate link

0.0	0.0	This is a never fail Your crisp recipes are always amazing and every summer I go back to this one Our pantry was a bit low and to make this dairy free I subbed melted coconut oil for the butter and it worked amazing I also didn t have any almond flour so I blitzed my oats to make oat flour in the blender instead and it made for a super dense and chewy topping
