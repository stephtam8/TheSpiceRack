0.0	0.0	Craving a refreshing summer treat An easy little project Something sweet but not too sweet These minty pineapple ice pops are just the ticket They re made with just two ingredients pineapple and mint		
0.0	0.0	These popsicles are naturally sweetened with fruit alone I actually make my pops with frozen pineapple which is easy and inexpensive		
0.0	0.0	This recipe was inspired by a popsicle we enjoyed on a hot summer afternoon in Nashville last year I insisted that we stop at Las Paletas for popsicles even though our bellies were still full from lunch		
0.0	0.0	As our popsicles dripped onto the porch in the heat I made a mental note to make similar popsicles at home We can t hop over to Nashville right now but at least we can enjoy some cold pops in the backyard

0.0	0.0	I designed this recipe to be made with frozen pineapple Why It s cheaper than fresh pineapple and we re freezing it again anyway Plus frozen pineapple is preserved at the peak of ripeness and it can be challenging to know when to cut into a fresh pineapple A few notes Be sure to use well preserved frozen pineapple not old frost bitten pineapple which will taste funny For food safety purposes it s important that you defrost the pineapple in the refrigerator not at room temperature and do not heat the pineapple to speed up the process This will take roughly two to four hours or you can just leave it overnight Let the pineapple thaw completely in the fridge or you ll have trouble blending it up Be sure to blend and re freeze the defrosted pineapple within 48 hours again for food safety Frozen pops will keep indefinitely under proper storage conditions though they may lose their flavor over time

0.0	0.0	Pineapple and mint is a classic combination in Brazil usually in smoothie form and with enough mint to turn it green It is my favorite When we visit my husband s family in Brazil I have a pineapple mint smoothie at every opportunity Will try these popsicles and probably up the mint Great idea
