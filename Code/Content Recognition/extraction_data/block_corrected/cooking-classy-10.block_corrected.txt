0.0	0.0	You wouldn t believe how well this recipe turns out even without a roux without heavy cream and without using multiple pans		
0.0	0.0	The trick is that the pasta is cooked in a concentrated amount of liquid therefor it gets super starchy and helps create a silky smooth and creamy sauce		
0.0	0.0	Honestly the recipe is almost too easy Does it get any better than pour and cook blend the cheese right in and only one pot to clean

0.0	0.0	Instant Pot Mac and Cheese Recipe Ingredients Chicken broth I use low sodium broth but regular will work too Vegetable broth could be substituted Elbow macaroni pasta This is added dry without cooking first It only needs to cook 3 minutes in the Instant Pot to reach an al dente bite Salt and pepper Add to taste Keep in mind the cheeses will add salt as well so don t overdue it I use about 1 tsp Half and half You may need a little more if you are in higher altitude or if you like a saucier pasta Start with the 1 2 cup listed and add more as needed Butter Dice into pieces so they melt faster At least 3 or more Sharp cheddar cheese If you are prefer a milder flavor you could use mild or medium cheddar but personally I think sharp is best Sharp white cheddar works well too Gruyere cheese This is a type of Swiss cheese you can get at the specialty cheese counter Water I like the combo of using water and broth Broth adds a bit of flavor but we don t want it to be overwhelming		
0.0	0.0	How to Make Mac and Cheese in the Instant Pot Add liquids pasta and salt to Instant Pot Pour water and chicken broth into Instant Pot Add pasta season with salt to taste and stir Cook 3 minutes Cover securely with lid set valve to sealing position Set to manual pressure and 3 minutes It will take about 10 minutes to come to pressure then time will start to count down After cooking is done do quick release Once time is up turn instant pot off and carefully do the quick release stand back it will steam intensely Once steaming has stopped completely and there s not pressure remaining remove lid Add fats Add butter and pour in half and half Gently toss until butter has melted Mix in cheese Add cheese and stir Let it rest for 1 minute then toss until cheese has melted if needed you can set Instant Pot to saute mode just briefly to help melt cheese Finish with pepper if desired and toasted panko		
0.0	0.0	Tips to Make it the Best Only use elbow macaroni pasta for consistent results Use freshly grated cheeses for a smooth sauce Pre grated cheeses are coated in starches and don t have the best flavor anyway Use boldly flavored cheeses so it doesn t taste bland Cook pasta for just 3 minutes for the perfect non soggy texture If you like them a bit softer past al dente you can do 4 minutes but no more than that Use quick release option to release remaining pressure once time is up Otherwise if pressure releases naturally it will be too slow and pasta will become too soft Add cheeses without heat on so they don t separate but rather melt smoothly If needed you can heat gently but be careful not to overdue it and scald the cheese		
0.0	0.0	Variations and Substitutes Serve with toasted panko breadcrumbs on top To do this just melt 1 2 tablespoons of butter in a skillet over medium high heat add 1 cup panko and saute until golden brown Use heavy cream for a richer option or whole milk for a lighter option Sneak in a steamed vegetable at the end like small diced broccoli or cauliflower Try with other cheeses see ideas below		
0.0	0.0	Best Cheeses for Mac and Cheese		
0.0	0.0	Get creative You can use up other cheeses you already have on hand but at least once try the cheddar and gruyere option I think it s best		
0.0	0.0	Use a smooth melting cheese Keep in mind some of these are more mild than others so pair with a sharper option Cheddar yellow or white Gruyere Gouda Monterey jack or colby jack Mozzarella Provolone Fontina Parmesan Havarti American

0.0	0.0	Only use freshly grated cheeses pre grated cheeses are coated with starches and won t melt smoothly They don t taste as good either Optionally you can top servings with toasted panko breadcrumbs Prepare while macaroni is cooking Melt 1 2 Tbsp butter in a 10 inch skillet over medium high heat Add panko and spread even let toast tossing frequently until golden brown Pour into a bowl so it doesn t continue to brown and set aside until ready to use

0.0	0.0	Sorry to hear that Are you sure it was adequately seasoned with salt Did you use the cheeses listed To boost flavor you can add an extra cup of cheese and use extra sharp if you prefer a boldly flavored mac and cheese October 20 2020 Reply
