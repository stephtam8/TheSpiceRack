0.0	0.0	Best Classic Tomato Soup Recipe		
0.0	0.0	One of my favorite lunches is this homemade tomato soup from scratch paired with a sourdough grilled cheese for dipping Talk about delicious		
0.0	0.0	This soup is so basic and so easy yet it s so flavorful It s proof that the simplest ingredients brought together can create something perfectly delicious well balanced in flavor and just simply satisfying		
0.0	0.0	Building up flavor with ingredients that have concentrated flavor is key and this soup is brimming with them The other great thing here is the decadent butter mellowing out the acidity of the tomatoes and enriching their flavor		
0.0	0.0	And you ll love the smooth texture of this soup it s perfectly sip able and cozy as can be		
0.0	0.0	Pair it with a sandwich salad or a hearty protein for a complete meal Or for a simple quick meal just pair it with fresh bread I recommend my no knead bread or cheese toast for dunking		
0.0	0.0	Tomato Soup Recipe Ingredients and Substitutes Unsalted butter Salted butter works fine too just add a little less salt to the soup Extra virgin olive oil may be substituted for a healthier alternative Yellow onions We use a fair amount here but their flavor is toned down some slightly since they are slightly caramelized Red onions could be substituted Garlic Fresh is preferred but pre chopped bottled garlic is a second best option All purpose flour This is used to thicken the soup If needed you could try a gluten free flour blend without xanthun gum or cornstarch Chicken broth Vegetable broth works well too I like to use low sodium to have more control over added salt Canned San Marzano tomatoes The ultimate canned tomatoes I know these can be pricey so for an alternative try canned plum Roma tomatoes Fresh basil This is truly a highlight of this soup No substitutes here Parmesan rind You ll love the hidden flavor this adds Parmesan rinds are my favorite for soup If you don t happen to have one then just finish the soup with fresh grated parmesan Granulated sugar I ve also used honey here instead The idea is just to balance any tartness with a hint of sweetness You can even omit or adjust to taste as preferred Salt and pepper Add to taste Heavy cream This ingredient is optional based on whether or not you re looking for a creamy tomato soup or just the classic You really don t need much about 1 Tbsp per serving goes a long way Half and half is also a great option

0.0	0.0	Can it be frozen		
0.0	0.0	Yes this soup freezes very well I ve actually got some frozen now for lunches To freeze Let soup cool Freeze in individual portions or larger portions based on how much you ll thaw at once Be sure to leave 3 4 inch empty space at the top for soup to expand when freezing otherwise dish can break Let thaw overnight in the fridge Reheat on the stove in a pot or saucepan over medium low heat Keep covered with a lid and stirring occasionally until heated through Or reheat in the microwave stirring occasionally until heated through		
0.0	0.0	Can I use fresh tomatoes		
0.0	0.0	Yes Fresh tomatoes will work well too Peel first Cut an x on bottom and add to pot of boiling water until peels will peel away easily Use equal weight of fresh high quality ripe tomatoes the soup will only taste as good as what you put into it		
0.0	0.0	How to Make it Vegan		
0.0	0.0	With a few simple changes you can make a vegan version of this Replace chicken broth with vegetable broth Omit parmesan rind replace with vegan parmesan for serving Replace heavy cream with coconut cream		
0.0	0.0	Tips to Perfect It Use best quality canned tomatoes for the best tomato flavor San Marzano are best or use plum Roma tomatoes Add fresh herbs here basil is the perfect compliment Brown onions slightly for an extra boost of flavor and use a fair amount of garlic Use flour to thicken the soup otherwise it s watery Simmer to soften tomatoes and blend flavors Blend very well to make it smooth and lump free

0.0	0.0	Honey may be substituted in place of sugar Adjust this amount according to desired preference I don t like it very sweet so 2 tsp is perfect for me You can increase or even omit Heavy cream not included in nutrition estimate as this is optional Half and half will work here too If you don t have an immersion blender you can use a countertop blender If doing so let soup cool slightly then puree soup in batches in blender don t fill more than halfway full and remove lid insert and cover with a kitchen towel when blending otherwise steam will build up and lid can burst open If you want soup a little thinner you can add some more more broth at the end
