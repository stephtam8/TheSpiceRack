0.0	0.0	Tortellini Soup Ingredients Olive oil This is used to encourage browning of the meat It also helps reduce sticking Ground beef Use lean ground beef 85 93 Yellow onion This is a critical ingredient that really builds up the background flavor of the soup don t skip it Celery If you want this to cook faster slice it thin it s a very crisp vegetable and requires more cooking time than other vegetables to become tender Carrots Dice these up small I think most of the time small dice is best for soup Garlic As always fresh is best Low sodium chicken broth Using low sodium gives a bit more control over the amount of salt You can even use unsalted to cut sodium in the recipe Canned diced tomatoes I like to use petite cut tomatoes but standard cut are fine Tomato sauce Similar to tomato passata in other countries if you aren t sure what to look for Italian seasoning If you don t have this just use 1 1 2 tsp dried basil 1 tsp dried oregano and 1 2 tsp dried thyme Cheese tortellini I highly highly recommend sticking with refrigerated tortellini not shelf stable it has a far superior flavor Spinach Opt for fresh not frozen spinach Frozen spinach will be mushy in soup Parsley Fresh parsley adds a lot more flavor here than dried would If you have fresh basil on hand sometimes I ll add that instead Salt and pepper Add to taste

0.0	0.0	Can it be frozen If you wait to add the tortellini then yes the soup can be frozen and it will freeze well for 3 months Freeze cooked tortellini in individual portions separate from soup		
0.0	0.0	Variations Use Italian sausage instead of ground beef Sneak in other vegetables such as zucchini green beans or asparagus Add red pepper flakes for a spicy kick Finish with parmesan if you want it extra cheesy or just let the soup simmer with a parmesan rind added Balance an acidic sauce with a teaspoon of sugar or honey if needed		
0.0	0.0	Tips to Perfect It		
0.0	0.0	Really this soup is a breeze and there s nothing complicated to it but here are a few tips to make it the best Brown the beef in chunks don t crowd and steam it This means let it sear on bottom before you begin to break it up and turn it and don t toss it the entire time or you ll end up with grey flavorless meat For even more fresh flavor you can swap the dried Italian seasoning with a blend of fresh herbs Try some basil oregano and thyme Don t add tortellini directly to the soup if you plan on leftovers or they ll be total mush the next day see the note in the recipe Be careful not to over cook the tortellini I usually even pull it off a minute or two early because I hate soggy pasta and the residual heat after removing keeps cooking it so by the time it s cool enough to eat the pasta is a bit soft for me Wait until the very end to add the spinach so it doesn t get soggy It will wilt almost instantly

0.0	0.0	If you plan on having leftover soup I highly recommend cooking the tortellini separately Reduce broth to 4 1 4 cups in soup then cook tortellini in a pot of boiling water separately from soup Toss tortellini with olive oil after draining Store separate from soup in fridge Add to servings separately near end of reheating
