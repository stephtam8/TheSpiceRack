0.0	0.0	Chicken Scampi Ingredients and Substitutes Boneless skinless chicken breasts Boneless skinless chicken thighs will work great too Just cook a little longer as needed All purpose flour I like to use unbleached all purpose flour 1 Tbsp cornstarch could be substituted Italian seasoning You can make your own blend using 3 4 tsp dried oregano 3 4 tsp basil and 1 2 tsp marjoram or thyme Salt and pepper Salt is used to season the chicken and also use to season your pasta when boiling Unsalted butter Salted butter could be used if needed just cut back on the amount of salt added to the dish Olive oil You ll only need a little here In a pinch another type of neutral flavored oil could be used Garlic I only recommend using fresh garlic here Dry white wine I like to use Sauvignon Blanc Low sodium chicken broth could be used but it won t have quite as much flavor Red pepper flakes These add a nice kick of heat it can be omitted if preferred If needed a little cayenne pepper can be substituted Fresh lemon juice If you had to lime juice could replace it Thin spaghetti Other good options are standard spaghetti angel hair linguine or fettuccine Parsley Dried could be substituted I d use 1 2 Tbsp it just won t be quite as fresh and flavorful Parmesan cheese Romano cheese will work great too

0.0	0.0	This is best served with some fresh vegetables that are steamed or roasted Here s some ideas steamed or roasted broccoli or asparagus oven roasted vegetables medley roasted zucchini squash and tomatoes or go with just baked zucchini		
0.0	0.0	Tips Don t skip drying chicken This removes some of the excess moisture on the exterior so it browns better Use a hot skillet to brown the chicken Preheat it More browning will equal far more flavor Select a decent wine A really cheap wine will just ruin the flavor Careful not to over cook the chicken or it will be dry Keep it warm in foil don t cover completely you don t want to continue to steam and cook it Keep wine away from flames its flammable from the alcohol Allow enough time for sauce to simmer Otherwise alcohol flavor will overwhelm the dish let the majority of it cook off Cook pasta to al dente for the perfect texture
