0.0	0.0	Chicken Taco Recipe Ingredients and Substitutes Boneless skinless chicken thighs Chicken breasts will work but they won t be quite as good as the thighs Olive oil Vegetable oil may be used instead Lime juice Lemon works just as well Chili powder You can also try using a blend of a few like chili powders such as Ancho New Mexican Pasilla etc Cumin Coriander would work too Different flavor but similar earthiness Garlic powder I like to use dry garlic powder so fresh doesn t burn up in a skillet A few teaspoons fresh minced could be substituted but wait until the last 30 seconds to add it to the skillet Paprika If you don t have smoked standard sweet paprika will work Cayenne pepper Red pepper flakes will work too Add these spicy ingredients to taste Salt and pepper Table salt kosher salt or sea salt can be used Tortillas This comes down to personal preference I use corn tortillas but flour tortillas will work great too Cilantro I like to add plenty of this at the end You can either toss in right with the chopped chicken or over each taco Red onion Or yellow white onion Also add other desired toppings

0.0	0.0	Tips for the Best Chicken Tacos This recipe is best with chicken thighs They are fattier and brown better and they don t dry as easy Use plenty of seasonings and be fair with the salt Go for a non stick skillet for less sticking And preferably use a heavy skillet for more even heat distribution If you find chicken is browning too quickly before it s cooking through then reduce burner temp As always Use fresh lime for best flavor Add extra upon serving
