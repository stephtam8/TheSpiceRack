0.0	0.0	If you want squash to be easier to cut then follow this method		
0.0	0.0	Use a sharp knife to pierce holes in squash along where you will be halving as if making a dotted around the squash do not skip this step of piercing through skin or steam can build up and cause squash to burst Place in microwave and cook for 5 minutes Let cool slightly before removing from microwave Cut along dotted line and proceed as directed in step 1 Tip If squash is tipping on one side prior to second bake prop it up with a strip of balled up aluminum foil underneath so filling doesn t spill out

0.0	0.0	Thank you for this new idea with spaghetti squash To cut the time I used my instant pot to cook the squash then scooped the squash into a casserole dish to mix all the ingredients When mixing in the cheese it reminded me of spinach artichoke dip so I threw spinach and artichokes in mine The kids preferred this dish without the spinach and artichokes October 5 2020 Reply

0.0	0.0	There are 2 things I noticed in addition to liking the flavor of this dish Too much cheese and dairy maybe if my spaghetti squash had been larger it would have worked but for 2 servings I chose a smaller one There should be a direction to place each half of the squash in a small loaf pan to finish it it tipped because of course the squash is round on a flat pan and half the filling ran out on the pan and had to be scooped up and placed back in the pan Thanks for suggesting parchment paper below the squash easier cleanup Pat September 23 2020 Reply

0.0	0.0	Sorry to hear that The ratio issue is likely due to the size of the spaghetti squash used I recommend sticking with the larger squashes or the other option is to cut the sauce and cheeses in half Then as far as the tipping a larger squash shouldn t do this but I ve listed a note at the bottom to prevent that from happening to anyone else A strip of balled up aluminum foil can help prop it up Thanks for your input September 23 2020 Reply
