0.0	0.0	Teriyaki Marinade Ingredients and Possible Substitutes Low sodium soy sauce If needed you can use 1 3 cup regular soy sauce mixed with 3 1 2 Tbsp water Mirin This is a Japanese rice wine you can find at most larger grocery stores in the Asian section A dry sherry wine or marsala wine can be substituted Light brown sugar This offers the marinade that irresistible sweetness Granulated sugar will work fine too Honey I like using the blend of two sweeteners for a two dimensional sweetness but if needed all brown sugar will work Rice vinegar This is a milder vinegar You could also use apple cider vinegar Garlic Fresh is best but 1 tsp dried granulated garlic will work to avoid an extra trip to the store Ginger Again fresh is best but if you must 1 tsp dried ginger will work Toasted sesame oil This is the darker sesame oil and it s often not labeled as toasted This ingredient has a unique flavor but you could also try perilla oil or unrefined peanut oil Chicken thighs chicken breasts will work well here too if you prefer them but as always be careful to cook just to 165 degrees in center so they don t start to dry out Cornstarch This is used to thicken a portion of the sauce to brush over the chicken after cooking You could try arrowroot or tapioca starch use twice as much tapioca here if needed Green onions and sesame seeds These are optional garnishes that add color and texture

0.0	0.0	How Long to Marinate Chicken in Teriyaki Sauce For best results marinate chicken at least 1 hour to allow time for some flavor to be absorbed Then preferably don t marinate longer than 8 hours as the acidity in the marinade can start to alter the texture of the chicken

0.0	0.0	Yes if you don t own a grill or if it s too cold out this could be oven baked To do so Preheat oven to 400 degrees Skip soaking in marinade in fridge it will bake with sauce for a while instead thicken all of the sauce with 2 tsp cornstarch and the water listed on the stovetop Place chicken in greased 13 by 9 inch baking dish pour over all the sauce Bake until it s cooked through About 20 30 minutes
