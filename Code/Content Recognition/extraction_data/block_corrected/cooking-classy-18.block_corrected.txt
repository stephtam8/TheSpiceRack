0.0	0.0	Homemade French Bread Pizza Ingredients French bread Use soft crusted french bread from the store that s wrapped in plastic wrap not paper Not only is it easier to cut but if you bake dry crust again it will become cardboard like I like to use one that is a day old so it s a little sturdier and it doesn t end up soggy Pizza sauce I highly recommend my homemade pizza sauce for this It will only add a few more minutes prep worth it Mozzarella I use aged part skim mozzarella but fresh mozzarella slices would be amazing too Parmesan cheese Honestly you could even use shelf stable Parmesan here since it s only 1 4 cup Olive oil standard refined or extra virgin will work great Another option is melted butter		
0.0	0.0	How to Make French Bread Pizza Prepare oven and baking sheet Move oven rack up one level and preheat oven to 425 degrees Line a rimmed 18 by 13 inch baking sheet with aluminum foil for easier clean up if desired Cut bread Cut french bread in half evenly through the length to create two long portions Cut each portion in half and place on baking sheet Brush bread with oil lightly toast Brush both sides with olive oil Turn upright and bake in preheat oven 4 minutes Add toppings Spread pizza sauce over each piece sprinkle evenly with mozzarella and parmesan cheeses then finish with desired toppings Bake again Bake in preheated oven until cheese is fully melted about 10 13 minutes If you d like it more browned then broil during the last 1 minute or so keep a close eye on it

0.0	0.0	These actually make great leftovers To properly store Let cool Wrap in plastic wrap or foil and transfer to refrigerator Store there up to 2 days		
0.0	0.0	How to Reheat My favorite method for reheating is to use a countertop oven To do so place cut slices on foil if it s safe according to manufacturer otherwise use a toast oven tray and toast for a few minutes Alternately you can reheat at 375 degrees on a baking sheet in the oven until heated through		
0.0	0.0	Time Saving Tips If needed use a good quality store bought pizza sauce instead of homemade Drizzle bread evenly with oil in a hurry rather than brushing Use pre shredded cheeses Fresh cut tastes best but we all have busy nights sometimes In a rush just melt the cheese using the broil feature of the oven keep a close eye on it

0.0	0.0	French Bread Notes My favorite French bread to use here is that from Walmart s bakery it s soft has a good flavor and it s just the right size for this use Don t use French bread that already has a dry crust the crust should be soft It should come in a plastic bag and not a paper bag or it will end up too dry and crisp after baking I like to use sturdier day old bread If it s not the same dimension as what is listed just adjust the amount of sauce and cheese added as needed Add enough to cover		
0.0	0.0	Sauce Note I highly recommend the homemade sauce but if time doesn t allow store bought will be fine Consider adding 1 minced garlic clove if it s mild in flavor and some Italian seasoning
