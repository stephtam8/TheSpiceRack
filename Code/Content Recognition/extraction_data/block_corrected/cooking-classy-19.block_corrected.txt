0.0	0.0	I usually love your recipes I tried this one tonight but the mustard was overpowering Next time I would only add 1 8 cup of the dijon My husband didn t like it either The chicken itself was very good but most of the mayo mustard topping fell into the grill I saved some to use as a dip for the chicken but it was just WAY too mustard y for us Maybe I should have added honey Would that make the mixture less mustardy August 26 2020 Reply

0.0	0.0	Sorry to hear that It does have a pronounced mustard flavor but to reduce that you can replace some Dijon with more mayo and yes add some honey August 27 2020 Reply
