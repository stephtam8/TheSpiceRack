0.0	0.0	Sausage Zucchini Boats Ingredients and Possible Substitutes Zucchini Look for those even in size about 8 9 oz each The should be big enough to hollow out and add filling but not too large or you won t be able to fit them in the baking dish Olive oil Another oil such as avocado oil will work fine here Italian turkey sausage Italian pork sausage can be used instead just drain of excess fat after browning Garlic In a pinch 1 tsp granulated garlic will work in this recipe Yellow onion Red onion would work here too Canned diced tomatoes I like the petite cut for a more uniform size throughout but regular cut will work Another option is to use 3 fresh roma tomatoes diced Italian seasoning Another option is to use 1 tsp dried basil and 1 tsp dried oregano Panko bread crumbs Standard dried bread crumbs will work too I just prefer the extra crisp texture of the panko Mozzarella cheese Monterey jack could be used in place of mozzarella Parmesan cheese Romano cheese will work here as well Parsley This ingredient is optional it can be omitted if you don t have any Another option is to use fresh basil or use 2 tsp dried parsley
