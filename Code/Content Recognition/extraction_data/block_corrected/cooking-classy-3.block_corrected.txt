0.0	0.0	Preheat oven and prepare baking sheet Preheat oven to 425 degrees Spray an oven safe wire cooling rack with non stick cooking spray and set over a rimmed baking sheet		
0.0	0.0	Make parmesan breading In a shallow dish toss together panko parmesan parsley garlic powder salt and pepper I use about 3 4 tsp salt and 1 2 tsp pepper Drizzle in olive oil and toss well to evenly coat mixture		
0.0	0.0	Separately beat egg In a separate shallow dish beat the egg until yolk and white are well blended		
0.0	0.0	Generously coat salmon Working with one piece of salmon at a time dredge each side in egg then transfer to panko mixture and cover and press both sides with panko mixture also sprinkle bread crumbs over top and press to help stick		
0.0	0.0	Place prepared salmon on rack Transfer to prepared wire rack on baking sheet Repeat process with remaining 3 portions Add extra bread crumbs to tops if there is extra left and press to an even layer		
0.0	0.0	Bake then serve with lemon wedges		
0.0	0.0	How Long to Bake Salmon Individual salmon fillets that are about 6 to 8 oz take anywhere from 10 15 minutes at 425 degrees Bake time just depends on their thickness		
0.0	0.0	Variations Try with other herbs Basil oregano marjoram or dill will all be good choices Finish with your favorite seafood sauce Substitute a similar cheese like Pecorino Romano Use 2 tsp fresh garlic in place of dried Just add to the breading For more richness you can coat salmon in mayonnaise instead of egg or drizzle a little additional olive oil over before baking Use chicken tenders instead of salmon Then test to doneness by checking internal temp to 165 degrees on an instant read thermometer		
0.0	0.0	Helpful Tips Work to use up all of the breading for a crispy well coated exterior When coating press to salmon so it sticks also sprinkle sprinkle some over and press Also spread and press coating on top into an even layer otherwise if you only sprinkle it and leave it there will be little pieces that burn on top If you find breading is browning too quickly simply tent with foil at any time needed If they aren t browning enough move oven rack up or broil just very briefly at the end Every oven browns a bit differently Careful not to over bake salmon or it s not as tender and starts to dry out
