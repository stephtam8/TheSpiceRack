0.0	0.0	The wild rice blend offers something that pasta doesn t in traditional chicken noodle soup It has a light natural sweetness to it then I ve included lemon zest to balance that with a faint little tang And all the herbs just nicely compliment and balance it all

0.0	0.0	Chicken and Wild Rice Soup Ingredients Wild rice blend I like to use Lundberg s blend Onion carrots and celery These are used to make the mirepoix which really flavor the soup Butter This makes the soup deliciously rich Garlic You can add more if preferred Chicken broth I like to use low sodium Regular will work fine just add less salt to the soup Thyme marjoram sage and rosemary You can use dried or fresh herbs Salt and pepper Season to taste Chicken breasts Thighs will work too just cook a little longer as needed Flour This helps thicken the soup don t omit If needed you could try a gluten free option below Milk I recommend using anything but skim milk Cream Half and half could be substituted

0.0	0.0	Make this chicken and wild rice soup gluten free		
0.0	0.0	If you are looking to make this soup gluten free it could probably be done by swapping out the flour for 1 3 the amount of cornstarch and blending it well with some of the milk instead of course you wouldn t be making a roux anymore but I d still add in some of the butter for flavor and richness Then check labels to ensure they are gluten free		
0.0	0.0	Can I freeze this soup		
0.0	0.0	Dairy doesn t freeze well because it can split and curdle so I wouldn t advise freezing it You can however store it in the fridge for up to 3 days		
0.0	0.0	Can I use leftover chicken or turkey		
0.0	0.0	Yes You can use leftover cooked chicken or turkey if you have some to use up If doing so wait until the end to add it so it doesn t get overcooked tough and dry

0.0	0.0	Good soup recipe But you can significantly cut down the butter and eliminate the cream to reduce the saturated fat content while not sacrificing taste Saute veggies in olive oil You can use about 2 tablespoons of butter with 1 4 cup of flour to make the roux Use 1 cup of milk and then add additional chicken stock if needed no cream You can save time and pots by adding rice to veggies then add stock to cook the rice Also can use leftover roast chicken instead of cooking the chicken breast And there you have it December 14 2020 Reply

0.0	0.0	Yes but cook time would be quite a bit less since jasmine rice would be done in about 15 to 20 minutes December 6 2020 Reply
