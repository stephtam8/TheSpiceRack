0.0	0.0	Italian Sausage Soup Recipe Ingredients and Substitutes Olive oil Another neutral flavored oil like avocado oil or even vegetable oil will work Italian sausage Plain pork sausage could be substituted then just up the Italian seasoning to 2 1 2 tsp and add 3 4 tsp fennel seeds if you have them Yellow onion A red onion will work if that s what you have Carrots Preferably don t omit the carrots If you are up for experimenting you can try parsnips Celery Another ingredient not to omit It really builds up the overall background flavor of the soup Bell pepper I use red bell pepper it s the ripest and sweetest but any color will work Garlic If you don t have fresh garlic you could use 1 1 2 tsp dried granulated just keep in mind it never tastes as fresh of course Chicken broth I recommend using low sodium so you have more control over the salt Vegetable broth or beef broth could be substituted Tomato sauce In some countries also known as passata Crushed tomatoes would also work here too Canned diced tomatoes If needed fresh tomatoes could work here as well if that s what you have Use 3 diced Roma tomatoes Italian seasoning You could also just use 1 2 tsp dried basil 1 2 tsp dried oregano and 1 2 tsp dried rosemary or marjarom Dry orzo pasta See variation notes below on substitutes Fresh basil and parsley Preferably stick with fresh herbs if possible You don t absolutely have to use both you could use one or the other Salt and pepper Season to taste

0.0	0.0	Can this soup be frozen Yes this soup will freeze well If you don t like soggy pasta then cook and freeze separately toss with olive oil Freeze up to 3 months		
0.0	0.0	Can I use another type of meat		
0.0	0.0	Yes you could use another type of ground meat in place of sausage You could use plain pork sausage as noted above Italian turkey sausage or ground beef		
0.0	0.0	Variatons Add other vegetables such as zucchini kale or spinach Try it with another pasta such as ditalini elbow or acini de pepe Or replace pasta with cheese tortellini Substitute diced cauliflower in place of the orzo to cut some of the carbs Season with other fresh herbs in place of dried Italian seasoning Rosemary and oregano are other great options add to taste Make it spicy by using hot Italian sausage or adding red pepper flakes to taste If you want it a little more stew like use 1 cup orzo		
0.0	0.0	Tips Break sausage into pieces in pot giving space between so they have a chance to brown on bottom rather than steam and only toss occasionally Careful not to over cook pasta I even cook shy of al dente because it will continue to cook off heat since the soup is so hot If you plan on leftovers you can cook pasta separately and store separately toss with a little olive oil so pasta doesn t get mushy For extra flavor try it with homemade chicken stock

0.0	0.0	Another recipe of yours that hits it out of the park and it is going to become a staple I ve made it a couple times now and my family loves it I ve made it with bow tie pasta and spiral pasta and one time I just threw in some leftover chicken broth that was not as much as you recommend and it came out like a goulash and not a soup and my family still loved it My son who usually hates onions even ate it and loved it and didn t complain about the onions because there are so many other flavors I love your site I love everything I have made so far and I love how you explain things You are really getting me to enjoy cooking December 17 2020 Reply
