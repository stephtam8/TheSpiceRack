0.0	0.0	Ingredients Needed for Oven Roast Turkey Breast and Gravy 6 lb bone in skin on turkey breast Fresh or frozen and fully thawed will work here Don t forget to plan ahead to allow plenty of time for thawing in the fridge Unsalted butter Salted butter works fine too Dry the turkey well with paper towels so the butter spreads on easier Garlic I like to use 1 Tbsp for a decent amount of flavor that isn t overpowering Thyme rosemary sage or parsley These are classic herbs for seasoning poultry You can use dried herbs if you don t want to pay the higher price for fresh Use 1 tsp of each Salt and pepper Season somewhat generously I use kosher salt but standard table salt is just fine Yellow onion carrot and celery These are used to season the drippings for gravy If you aren t making gravy then just skip them Flour This ingredient thickens the gravy Low sodium chicken stock Used to make gravy preferably go for homemade I make this anytime we buy rotisserie chicken or make roast a chicken then just freeze it for later
