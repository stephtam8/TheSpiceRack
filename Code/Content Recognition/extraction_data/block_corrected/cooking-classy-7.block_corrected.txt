0.0	0.0	Chicken Pot Pie with Biscuits Ingredients Yellow onion Here we lightly brown the onion just a little to add more flavor Butter Use unsalted butter for this recipe All purpose flour I like to use unbleached flour Low sodium chicken broth For maximum flavor try it with homemade chicken stock Half and half If you want it even richer you could try heavy cream just keep in mind you ll need a little more since it s thicker Thyme rosemary and parsley You can use fresh or dried Frozen mixed vegetables Opt for a blend that has carrots peas green beans and corn Rotisserie chicken Another option is to make your own roasted chicken or use other leftover chicken meat Baking powder and baking soda These leavening agents are used for the biscuits so they rise nice and tall Buttermilk I like to use buttermilk in biscuits instead of milk it adds a lot more flavor Salt and pepper Careful not to forget this or the recipe will taste totally flat I ve learned this the hard way with dinner rolls They seemed tasteless

0.0	0.0	How to make the filling Prepare oven Adjust oven rack to upper 1 3 of the oven Preheat oven to 425 degrees Saute onion in butter Melt butter in a 12 inch wide by 2 1 4 inch deep cast iron skillet over medium heat Add onions and saute until slightly golden brown about 8 10 minutes Make roux Add flour and saute 1 minute longer Add liquids and seasonings While whisking slowly pour in chicken broth then half and half Add thyme rosemary and season with salt and pepper to taste Let thicken Cook until it just lightly simmers stirring constantly then reduce heat to low and cook until it s just thickened slightly Add vegetables Mix in vegetables and chicken and cook about 30 seconds longer it doesn t need to be fully heated through Remove from heat and set aside

0.0	0.0	Can store bought biscuits be used		
0.0	0.0	Yes Homemade truly are so easy I recommend you to try them at least once But when you don t have the extra 5 minutes you could substitute store bought biscuits such as Pillsbury or Annie s Just reduce oven temperature to 375 so biscuits don t burn and check it a little early		
0.0	0.0	Can it be baked in a baking dish		
0.0	0.0	Yes this can also be baked in a 9 by 13 inch baking dish instead of a cast iron skillet If you use glass or ceramic don t use the broil option at the end though or dish can break		
0.0	0.0	Variations You can use fresh vegetables They ll just need to be saut√©ed first since they aren t as tender as the blanched frozen vegetables Add a leftover baked potato or some sliced fresh mushrooms If adding extra vegetables then be sure to bake in a baking dish so filling doesn t bubble over and cause a mess in your oven Finish biscuits with melted butter for extra buttery flavor		
0.0	0.0	Helpful Tips Don t overwork biscuit dough For fluffy tender biscuits mix just until flour mixture is incorporated Brown onions just slightly for an added layer of flavor Go for homemade chicken stock if time allows Lately I ve even been making that stock recipe and using twice the amount of chicken bones browned skin for a more concentrated broth then you can reconstitute it after you ve frozen it Or don t reconstitute and it makes the most delicious homemade chicken gravy Use both breast and thigh chicken meat for great flavor

0.0	0.0	Made your Chicken Pot Pie with Biscuits and I forgot to add the flour at the beginning stage If that happens can you add the flour layer like into the sauce or will it make the sauce taste like raw flour If forgetting the flour at the beginning stage anyway to thicken it later on like your recipe says Also is the biscuits suppose to be submerged into the sauce If want to add melted butter on biscuits add more buttery flavor do you add that before you bake or is that when it s done baking to add the melt butter November 19 2020 Reply

0.0	0.0	I would probably opt to thicken with cornstarch instead so there won t be a raw flour taste I d use 4 tsp Then the biscuits shouldn t be submerged just resting atop the filling And the melted butter should be brushed over after baking November 19 2020 Reply
