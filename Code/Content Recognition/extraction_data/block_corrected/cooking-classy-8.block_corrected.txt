0.0	0.0	Baked Chicken Thighs Ingredients Chicken thighs Bone in skin on chicken thighs are used here for more flavor Olive oil This is used to encourage browning Lemon The zest is used to season the chicken then wedges are used for spritzing upon serving I like to wait to add the juice just so chicken skin gets crispier in the oven without the added liquid Garlic Another alternative is to use 2 tsp garlic powder Italian seasoning Make your own blend using 1 tsp each basil oregano and thyme then 1 2 tsp each marjoram and rosemary Paprika This adds a nice light flavor and also improves color Salt and pepper Season with a fair amount

0.0	0.0	Tips Use evenly sized chicken thighs so they finish cooking at the same time Don t skip drying chicken with paper towels The extra moisture doesn t allow chicken to brown and crisp up as nicely Wanting to reduce smoking Place chicken thighs over a layer of chopped vegetables such as potatoes and carrots instead of a on cooling rack Increase bake time slightly Always take temperature to test for doneness Check temperature in thickest area of chicken thighs

0.0	0.0	If you opt to broil you may want to drain fat from baking sheet before broiling to reduce smoking After broiling I like to brush away browned garlic pieces from the top as these can be bitter They season the chicken while baking but once browned the flavor isn t the same Homemade Italian Seasoning mix 1 tsp basil 1 tsp oregano 1 tsp thyme 1 2 tsp marjoram 1 2 tsp rosemary
