0.0	0.0	Easy Pasta Carbonara		
0.0	0.0	Pasta carbonara is one of those simple dinners we should all know how to make It s the perfect go to for a busy weeknight and it s also a dish fit for the weekend or even to serve to guests		
0.0	0.0	It seems like one of those dinners with so few ingredients that how could you possibly mess it up but oh how you can if you aren t using with the right method I m no expert on carbonara which is why I turned to Cook s Illustrated they are the kitchen geniuses		
0.0	0.0	This recipe works so well because pasta is boiled in less water with to really concentrate the starches which will help bind everything in the sauce and prevent separation when you add it to the egg mixture		
0.0	0.0	Another helpful tip is that the bacon is simmered in water first Bacon seems easy to burn or can cook unevenly in a skillet and pieces stick But when going this route and cooking it in water first it works like a charm		
0.0	0.0	And lastly this recipe contains the perfect ratio of eggs and yolks or one yolk in this case to have the perfect carbonara custard rich flavor and the perfect consistency		
0.0	0.0	Recipe originally lists Romano cheese but I always have Parmesan on hand so I went with that to keep the simple weeknight meal idea here but I m sure Romano would also be delicious Better yet use half of each Just be sure it s freshly grated Enjoy		
0.0	0.0	What is Carbonara		
0.0	0.0	If you ve never had homemade pasta carbonara before you re in for a real treat Pasta carbonara typically features a creamy sauce that s made with pancetta garlic heavy cream cheese and eggs The egg based sauce is cooked by combining it with the piping hot spaghetti pasta and a little of the cooking water		
0.0	0.0	For this easy carbonara recipe I used bacon instead of pancetta since it s generally easier to find But otherwise this is a pretty authentic carbonara recipe		
0.0	0.0	Pasta Carbonara Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	For this pasta carbonara recipe you ll need the following ingredients Bacon Water Garlic Spaghetti or linguine Grated Parmesan Eggs Salt and pepper Fresh parsley		
0.0	0.0	How to Make Pasta Carbonara Add bacon and water to a skillet and bring to a simmer Continue simmering until water is evaporated then continue to cook the bacon until crispy Remove bacon from pan and reserve the drippings Saute garlic in that same skillet until golden brown then add to a bowl with 1 tablespoon bacon fat eggs egg yolk Parmesan and pepper Mix well Meanwhile cook the spaghetti or linguine pasta until al dente Once cooked drain pasta and reserve 1 cup of the cooking water Slowly pour the hot cooking water into the egg mixture Then pour over the hot pasta and toss to coat Add crumbled bacon Let pasta rest for a few minutes tossing frequently until the carbonara sauce thickens Serve immediately with a sprinkle of fresh parsley		
0.0	0.0	Is it Safe to Eat Raw Eggs in Carbonara Sauce		
0.0	0.0	With eggs it is not recommend to serve partially cooked egg to the elderly and children The food safe temperature for eggs is 160 degrees and in Pasta Carbonara the eggs won t reach that temperature or they d be scrambled		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use Another Type of Cheese in the Sauce		
0.0	0.0	Yes any hard Italian cheese should work well in this sauce Romano cheese would taste delicious in this recipe as would a blend of cheeses		
0.0	0.0	Does This Pasta Reheat Well		
0.0	0.0	No pasta carbonara is one of the Italian dishes that doesn t reheat well The creamy sauce thickens in the fridge and loses its silky texture But don t throw away leftovers as they ll still taste fine		
0.0	0.0	Tips for the Best Pasta Carbonara Use freshly grated Parmesan not the stuff in the shaker can It ll melt better and gives this dish a richer flavor Be sure you immediately add the hot pasta water into the egg mixture to help cook it if needed you could even re warm it in the microwave but it needs to be very hot Pasta carbonara is best enjoyed immediately after you make it

0.0	0.0	Use real Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for fresh flavor and only freshly grated It will melt better and gives this dish a richer flavor I like to use a zest to grate it Slightly pack when measuring or use a kitchen scale Be sure you immediately add the hot pasta water into the egg mixture to help cook it if needed you could even re warm the water it in the microwave but it needs to be very hot If you want a thicker sauce another option I have tried is to toss the pasta with the sauce mixture in a large heat proof bowl set over a pot of simmering water cooking for only about 1 minute or just until thickened nicely Careful not to overdue it or it can be gluey Recipe adapted from Cook s Illustrated

0.005780346820809248	0.0	In Italy this is pasta dish that does not use garlic It can use minced or chopped shallot or yellow onions I learned the authentic recipe living in Florence Italy for a year This is a romantic middle of the night dish fir lovers so easy to make in between dinner breakfast Nothing overpowers a delicate dish like Carbonara of eggs bacon parsley than a pile of overpowering garlic If anything use a half a chopped shallot or a bit of chopped yellow onion saute in olive oil stir 8n when you stir in bacon peppered pancetta is what is used for this dish in Italy You can add a bit of milk or cream to stir in if the pasta seems dry I was so happy your recipe omitted green peas which really upsets Italians because they are not added to this dish I only make this with angel hair or Cappelli pasta to keep it from being to filling Thank you for your great selection of recipes October 24 2020 Reply	parsley
