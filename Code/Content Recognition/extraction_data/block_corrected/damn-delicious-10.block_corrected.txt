0.0	0.0	We loved this I followed the recipe exactly and did add the sriracha I m not a huge fan of orange which is the predominant flavor but I must admit that I DID devour the entire dish It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside so good And I liked the fact that you can prep everything in advance and then just cook it up quickly when you are ready I cooked the broccoli during the last few minutes that the chicken was in the pan and then served everything piping hot the second it came off the stove By the way I found that the amount of food specified in the recipe was enough to feed myself my husband and my 16 year old with no leftovers Thank you again Chungah for another wonderful recipe

0.0	0.0	So good Not orange y flavored at all This was quick to put together and a hit with kids and hubby and I added the Sriracha I accidentally added all the corn starch to the chicken instead of dividing for the sauce and sauce still thickened up well after the 3 minutes

0.0	0.0	Delicious I pretty mulched followed the recipe but make a couple of minor changes		
0.0	0.0	I made the chicken and sauce in advance put it in a casserole and stuck it in the refrigerator until dinner time then reheated it in the microwave and added the toasted sesame seeds just before serving to keep the from getting too soggy I also cut up the broccoli in advance and cooked it just before serving along with the rice		
0.0	0.0	As for the sauce which is the heart of this recipe I added two teaspoons of toasted sesame oil to kick up the flavor a bit and I minced the ginger root and increased both it and the garlic to about 2 tablespoons Also used the Sriracha it did not make the sauce too hot And I agree that the orange flavor is not overly strong All good		
0.0	0.0	BTW the one green onion must be a misprint I minced one BUNCH of green onions about 7 using just the white and light green portions Yeah I love onions

0.0	0.0	I was hesitant to make it because of all of reviews saying it was too orangey I disagree completely It tasted just like the sesame chicken I get from my local takeout spot		
0.0	0.0	I stayed true to the recipe except for 2 things I used chicken breast instead of thighs only because that s all I had and I used some sesame oil when cooking the chicken I don t think it made a difference Would make this again 5 stars

0.0	0.0	We made this the other night using chicken breasts instead of thighs because that s what we had I cut the chicken into quite small pieces The whole family loved it except all felt the orange flavor was too strong I agree and would make again definitely but would not add the marmalade I did add extra siracha as we like the heat

0.0	0.0	This was AH MAZING I took advice from some comments below and used sesame oil to cook chicken I kinda cheated and used Steam Fresh microwave broccoli cooked 4 minutes instead of 5 for some crunch I topped it with some dry roasted peanuts and some fresh chopped cilantro

0.0	0.0	I made this and all I can say is WOW better than take out for sure The only thing I would recommend is that when you cut up the chicken thighs take a little extra care to remove the fat I m going to try doubling the sauce mixture and keeping half of it without the corn starch in the freezer for next time
