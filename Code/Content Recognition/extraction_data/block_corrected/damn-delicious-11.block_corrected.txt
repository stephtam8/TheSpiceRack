0.0	0.0	Chungah I don t know of any other blog that so consistently delivers recipes that are easy to make and come out tasting so good These gnocchi are another total winner I cheated and microwaved the potatoes jabbed holes in them with a fork and then microwaved for 12 minutes turning them once midway After scooping and mashing them I spread them out a bit to cool faster Took 10 15 minutes I used that time to get other ingredients measured out to put water on to boil and to prep two other dishes I boiled the gnocchi then finished them in a pan with some melted butter and olive oil some garlic salt and pepper and some kale and broccolini from our garden The gnocchi picked up the garlicky flavour and had a nice shiny coating The pillowy softness of the gnocchi contrasted beautifully with the crispness of the broccolini A fantastic meal that took much less than an hour from start to finish to make and maybe 20 minutes of actual work Thank you I ll be making these gnocchi again and look forward to trying them with all sorts of sauces
