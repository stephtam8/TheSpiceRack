0.0	0.0	Simple and delicious with little to clean up at the conclusion of Easter day Thank you for the wonderful recipe made as written with the exceptions of substituting brown sugar for orange marmalade as I d forgotten to purchase with my last shopping trip and spooning more of the cream sauce on top of the potatoes so they were all coated My husband LOVED the scalloped potatoes and he typically is not a fan but I am and I m the cook

0.0	0.0	Easiest Easter dinner of my life One skillet 2 baking sheets and a few measuring cups Clean up was a breeze And oh so GOOD My very picky eaters raved about the delicious flavors of each dish They kept going back for more all 4 of us had large portions and I still have ham for next day I will definitely make this meal again NOTE prep time was more like 40 minutes and the potatoes took a little longer to pre cook Start to finish first time through took 2 hours total I would also take out asparagus sooner as carrots needed a little more time

0.0	0.0	Simply delicious thank you for helping to make our Easter dinner a great one The asparagus cooked faster than the carrots and so next time I use this recipe I ll choose smaller carrots I will also salt the potatoes better but they were so creamy and perfectly done

0.0	0.0	I made this last night because my husband is a firefighter and is working today It was SO good and SO easy to make I bought pre cored pineapple and used my mandoline slicer for the potatoes Even the biscuits were quick and easy to make It was heavy on the herbs for me I used dried and cut the measurement in half because of that but was still pretty heavy So if you arent a fan of big herby flavors just season to taste Otherwise it was a huge hit
