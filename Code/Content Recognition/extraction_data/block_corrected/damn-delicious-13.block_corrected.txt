0.0	0.0	For all the chefs out there struggling with the mess that can happen while venting on your Instapot After checking out other recipes it seems the key is layering your ingredients and not stirring them Start with chicken broth cream seasoning and then pasta I did not add chicken because I was roasting one in the oven Also I waited 5 minutes to release pressure Don t use any substitute for the heavy cream it will curdle for some reason It was soooooo yummy Hope that helps

0.0	0.0	Decent flavor but it made a GIANT mess of my Instant Pot and my oak floor It looked like it snowed in my kitchen Never had that happen before I seriously am hoping my instant pot isn t ruined When I went to release the pot creamy sauce blew everywhere through the steam vent I mean EVERYWHERE I can t imagine I am on the only one who this happened to The sauce was oozing through every crevasse of my instant pot steam vent and spraying across the floor My instant pot my stove and my floor were white with sauce So 10 minutes later after cleaning my house we got to try the pasta		
0.0	0.0	The pasta was VERY al dente and I followed the time precisely so I would use a smaller pasta next time Maybe spaghetti that requires less cook time so it is a little softer with this timeline The chicken was the perfect texture not overcooked or undercooked		
0.0	0.0	I also found that it was heavy like elmers glue I am more of a wine with a little alfredo fan like they make in Italian Restaurants This had the same texture as the stuff out of a jar Not bad flavor but it is VERY thick sauce

0.0	0.0	To address the geyser issue when releasing pressure I only did 4 minutes manual then let it go 2 min natural release Even doing that I had to put a towel right by the valve and release slowly If I started going too fast it definitely tried to sputter out the sauce So go slow I let it sit for the 3 minutes but it was still very soupy Stirred in the cheese which didn t help as much as I thought it would I removed the inner pot to let it sit for awhile thinking cooling it down would thicken it but nope I ended up adding a bit of cornstarch It really is delicious though We have been in a dinner rut my kids ate like all of it I think next time I will add a full 16oz of noodles because there is so much sauce And that would help too with the soupy issue This one will be added to my rotation for sure Thank you

0.0	0.0	FYI this recipe doubled beautifully I did not have white wine on hand gasp so I just omitted it I didn t increase any of the other liquids I was worried about the mess others mentioned so I cooked on high pressure for 4 minutes covered the IP with a find rag and natural pressure release for 2 and then I slowly let the remaining pressure escape Also since I doubled it I was worried about there not being enough room for the chicken so I oven roasted the breasts and they were done at the same time

0.0	0.0	If it let off steam during the cooking time you must not have had it sealed Either your vent was open or you didn t have the seal inside the lid or something And since it never counted down it must not have come to full pressure which makes sense if it wasn t properly sealed Then because you lost steam you lost liquid and that s why it burned and was dry Also you didn t need to increase the cook time for frozen chicken It just would have taken longer to come to pressure But don t give up Once you get the hang of it using the pressure cooker is great

0.0	0.0	Never made pasta in the instant pot before It all stuck together and the dairy curdled So make sure you don t try to substitute the heavy cream I used evaporated milk which should have been fine Flavor was fine Luckily the kids believed me when I said the curdled milk was extra cheese I used chicken breasts since that s what I had in the fridge I might try pasta on top since it stuck to the bottom and I got the burn message

0.0	0.0	Look up a complete good to cooking chicken basically goes over cooking every kind of chicken in the instant pot basically it s about the thickness of the chicken pretty sure chicken breasts cooked whole was anywhere from 20 30 minutes cooking longer at least when it s the dark meat like thighs results in a more fall off the bone kind of meat But if I remember right even a whole chicken was at most 30 minutes There s a guide where she talks about how pain staking this was and how she won t eat chicken for a long time I m sure you ll find it Or just realize chicken is very forgiving She did say that chicken breast didn t come out nearly as well as dark meat did and I think this recipe with dark meat would be much better

0.0	0.0	You are just browning the chicken on the saute setting You definitely put it back into the pot to finish cooking with all the ingredients for 6 minutes on high Hope this helps
