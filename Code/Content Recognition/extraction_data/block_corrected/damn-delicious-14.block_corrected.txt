0.0	0.0	Delicious Some reviewers mentioned that their carnitas didn t turn out like the picture I made sure to use exactly one pound of meat on medium high heat not too low in a iron skillet and they turned out perfectly Thank you for another great recipe Chungah

0.0	0.0	Mine did come out as pictured nicely browned As some other commenters have already said you need to make sure the pan is really hot It might help to use a cast iron pan but even if you don t the oil needs to be very hot before the pork goes in the pan And then instead of stirring frequently let the pork onion garlic mixture sit awhile in between stirring so the meat can brown against the surface of the pan It might take longer than 8 10 minutes As the liquid cooks off stir only occasionally and scrape browned bits from the pan It ll brown

0.0	0.0	My husband and I loved this EASY and Delicious Carnitas recipe Due to the Coronavirus quarantine I was only missing the cilantro Which I love immensely Also it was a little difficult to cut the loin into 1 2 pieces Slippery to handle Maybe put the meat in the freezer for 30 minutes to firm up Then proceed to cutting Any way it was an awesome easy yummy meal I have loved making so many of your recipes and look forward to your next one
