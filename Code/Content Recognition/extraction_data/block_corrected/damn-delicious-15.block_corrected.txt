0.0	0.0	LIving up to its name this dish is damn delicious Made it last night with a package of 10 chicken thighs so the sheet pan was a little tight to stir in kale Just layered it on top then spooned some of the juice over it prior to serving Used small russet potatoes quartered fresh rosemary and dried thyme Chicken and potatoes were cooked perfectly Will definitely make again Thanks

0.0	0.0	Easy and delicious I left out the thyme and used parsley on the potatoes I didn t have kale so I added asparagus from the start and it caramelized beautifully As with all dishes I find on this site there were hardly any leftovers

0.0	0.0	My husband and I loved the sheet pan rosemary lemon chicken I cut the recipe down to 4 chicken thighs and I did it in my cast iron frying pan in the oven too That way you don t have to transfer the meat to the sheet pan unless you re making the recipe with the larger amount of chicken Then the frying pan wouldn t be large enough to accommodate all the ingredients Came out excellent And I loved the kale I think I ve tried eating kale once before but didn t like it This I loved The kale I purchased was all chopped up in cellophane bag Perfect Will be making this again Loved using the tiny potatoes too

0.0	0.0	This may be much too late to be helpful but I made this with chicken breasts and it turned out lovely I halved two chicken breasts so there would be more pieces like if I were using thighs and used 2 tbsp olive oil instead of one and they stayed moist

0.0	0.0	Spinach might wilt instead of getting crispy like the kale would since kale is more of a sturdy vegetable and spinach has such a high water content I think I m going to try this recipe with broccoli or asparagus and adjust the cooking time for them since I don t have kale and don t want to go to the grocery store in this chaos
