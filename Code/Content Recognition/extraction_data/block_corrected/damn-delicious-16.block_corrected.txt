0.0	0.0	Another winner Subbed out ground beef with Beyond Italian Sausage which while not great on it s own saut√©ed with the veg a lil extra basil fennel and red pepper flakes was great in this sauce The small amount of sugar in your recipe really adds to the balance of acids I ve always been disappointed in previous attempts at homemade pasta sauce as the effort never seemed to exceed the convenience or ultimately taste of good jarred this recipe is exceptional Fresh full flavor and easy to whip up while getting your pasta and sides sorted Thank you
