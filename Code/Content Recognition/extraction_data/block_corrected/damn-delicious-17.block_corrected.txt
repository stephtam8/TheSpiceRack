0.0	0.0	So so good Lots of protein and veg I swapped the rice for quinoa and used a fuji apple instead of a pear in the marinade because that s all I had on hand and it was still awesome The chicken marinade was amazing and I can t wait to try it with a pear next time My husband loved it and so did I Will definitely make again soon

0.0	0.0	I happened to have all but one of these ingredients on hand and I made this yesterday for lunch I didn t have a pear so I used an apple I figured the job of the pear was to add a little sweetness and for the pectin to tenderize the meat An Apple will do the same thing in a marinade This recipe was incredibly flavorful and the textures of crunchy soft along with the bite of kimchi and the creaminess of avocado was spot on Can t wait to try the marinade on other proteins

0.0	0.0	Loved the flavors in this whole dish It s Winter here so no grilling outside but we used cast iron skillet and crisped up the marinated chicken thighs in the oven perfection I hoped that I would love kimchi like my husband does he craves it but alas only could handle a little of it Added a fried egg over the rice rather than a hard boiled and sprinkled sriracha miso sauce over the top OMG loved it kimchi all Thankyou Chungah
