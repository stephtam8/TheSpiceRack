0.0	0.0	I made this for dinner tonight and it was a huge win I didn t have any white wine so I used a little extra chicken stock and some apple cider vinegar I used chicken breasts and pounded them flat ish with my rolling pin that took some extra time but they cooked very quickly in the pan 4 minutes each side I served it over protein plus angel hair pasta The perfect high protein meal for Sunday dinner Will definitely be making this again
