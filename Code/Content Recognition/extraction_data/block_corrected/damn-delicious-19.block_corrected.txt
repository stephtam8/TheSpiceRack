0.0	0.0	I used leftover roast top round and used 4 cups of stock since I added so much meat and veggies also didn t have any red wine I should ve added the potatoes at the same time as the meat though because it took WAY too long to cook and the meat got really shredded and mushy I omitted the mushrooms as I don t care for them cooked Overall this was a VERY flavorful dish and I will make it again with a few tweaks Thanks for another Damn Delicious meal
