0.0	0.0	This recipe is AWESOME unsurprisingly Everything I ve made from Damn Delicious is just that I used your recipe for homemade dumplings and they were great I didn t have an oven safe skillet so I transferred everything to a glass casserole dish and it worked out really well I doubled the garlic and used two shallots Next time I might use a little bit more flour to make the sauce a little thicker but it was still incredible

0.0	0.0	Oh my goodness This is the best thing I ve eaten in a long time Made it for dinner tonight Doubled the sauce and gnocchi and sautéed some shrimp on the side for the non meat eaters Added some extra seasonings onion powder garlic powder smoked paprika and Tony Chachere s to the chicken and btw I m so not a thigh fan but I went with them anyway and I m glad I did Also added those seasonings to the sauce And speaking of that sauce I could drink it by the cupful it s that damn delicious Love the way the kale still has a bit of crunch to it but I think spinach would be good too in a pinch Oh and didn t have wine so I used extra broth
