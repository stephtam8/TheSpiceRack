0.0	0.0	Do you ever forget to thaw your frozen ground beef and realize that dinner will be an absolute disaster		
0.0	0.0	Because this probably happens to me at least once a week I always have some frozen ground beef to use up except I never remember to thaw it in time		
0.0	0.0	But now you don t have to worry about any thawing at all Nope No thawing no worries You can use your ground beef and go straight from freezer to your Instant Pot		
0.0	0.0	You just need TWO 1 pound frozen bricks of ground beef here totaling 2 pounds I DO NOT RECOMMEND THROWING IN A 2 POUND BRICK AS ONE PIECE it will not cook in the allotted time here		
0.0	0.0	So two frozen bricks some seasonings and boom you re done The IP will cook it absolutely perfectly with your homemade taco seasoning And when you open up your pressure cooker make sure you let it simmer for 5 6 minutes until it gets real saucy breaking up the meat as it cooks

0.0	0.0	Very good This recipe was a hit with my family The only issue was I got the burn message But after cleaning up and starting the meat over luckily it was just stuck on the bottom and not actually burned it turned out great I did add some red Bell pepper To increase the veggies and I made it with 4 lbs of meat fed a crowd doubles everything except the chilis and will do that next time Definitely a keeper Read reviews saying use the trivet will do that next time too

0.0	0.0	So fast and easy excellent flavor versatile as a filling or topping We enjoyed this on low sodium tortilla chips topped with finely shredded Fiesta blend cheese medium salsa and light sour cream I added a can of undrained seasoned blackbeans to the ground beef on top of the seasoning before cooking in the IP Came out great The meat finished cooking as a solid chunk so I used my shredded pork meat shredders to break it up in the pot Worked out very well This will be among my go to recipes Thank you for sharing

0.0	0.0	It was good but I got a burn error I was reading other cooking blogs for the instant pot and they said you should use at least 1 cup of liquid and put the cornstarch in after the pressure cooking cycle Not sure if you have come across this at all

0.0	0.0	I halved the recipe and used a 3 quart mini Lux It turned out great I did use a trivet to place the frozen meat on and also added the corn starch and 2 tbsp of tomato sauce at the end just before using the sauté setting
