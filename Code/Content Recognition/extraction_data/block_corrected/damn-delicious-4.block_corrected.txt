0.0	0.0	This was my first recipe after seeing a recommendation for the site on a local moms Facebook group I am not disappointed The soup turned out really delicious and now I m buying three cookbooks for my family and friends for Christmas We busy ladies need this wisdom and the really well thought out details photos I especially appreciate some of the Asian American and Chicagoan references too as I identify with both		
0.0	0.0	I do have a question for anyone who s game to respond I made this in my slow cooker on high 5 hrs then added pasta cooking another 30 mins Of course I taste tested it midway through because it was just too tempting Is there really an advantage of cooking it beyond 3 4 hours Will flavor improve Was thinking if it doesn t make a difference I d try to preserve some nutrients and take out a third of the cooking time Thoughts

0.0	0.0	This was FANTASTIC I bought a pound of ground sausage instead of removing links from the casing otherwise I followed the recipe exactly well I did it on the stovetop and allowed it to simmer awhile before adding the pasta to cook for 30 minutes This is so full of flavor and makes a huge pot I brought some to my neighbors and they have asked that I share the recipe with them Yet another WINNER from Ms Chungah thank you

0.0	0.0	Most if not all instant pots have a slow cooker feature So you should be able to saute right in the pot remove excess fat and the follow recipe directions with slow cooker feature I would however add a little of the chicken stock after I drained excess fat and scrape that delicious fond from the bottom of the pot to incorporate it into the soup Then just use instant pot as a slow cooker		
0.0	0.0	If you want to do it using pressure cooker features you can search a similar instant pot recipe as a guide for steps and times but still follow this recipe for ingredients Hope that s helpful
