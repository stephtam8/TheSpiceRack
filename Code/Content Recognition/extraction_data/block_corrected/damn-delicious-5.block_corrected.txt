0.0	0.0	Amazing I only used 4 thighs so I decreased the potatoes by about half my kids won t eat potatoes except in fry form and I decreased the chicken broth by a cup since I read some thought it was thin It was still a bit thin so I added a corn starch slurry 1 TBS corn starch and 2 TBS warm water and added that after the chicken was done took the chicken out and covered added back when it was all mixed Perfect The flavor was amazing I did cut the baby yellows in half to make sure they were cooked enough and they were perfect Delicious dinner

0.0	0.0	I made this last night and it was delicious I used 2 pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs and 16 oz of mushrooms I also pre cooked the potatoes in the microwave before throwing them in the pot to make sure they got cooked Lastly I added a couple of teaspoons of chicken Better than Bullion at the end instead of salt I will definitely make this again but will add more chicken 3 pounds and serve it over mash potatoes to soak up the sauce The sauce is fantastic

0.0	0.0	Made this last night for dinner and boy was it tasty The only changes I made were to slice thickly rather than halve the mushrooms and to use dried herbs rather than fresh it s what I had Next time because there will be a next time I ll probably use boneless skinless thighs and maybe make a cornstarch water slurry to thicken the sauce a bit This recipe as made however was damn delicious

0.0	0.0	The flavors are delicious but I did have some issues with my results and wonder if I messed up somewhere I used four large bone in thighs so that is the only difference I made Everything else I followed as written As a casserole I expected the sauce to be thicker I ended up with broth		
0.0	0.0	Even though the instructions don t specify I left it uncovered The potatoes didn t cook all the way through and that may be my fault because I figured cutting the potatoes into quarters would have been the better size And my potatoes may have been larger than what is in the picture Still really good flavor Maybe serving over mashed potatoes could work Definitely worth trying again

0.0	0.0	This is my new dinner party recipe My repertoire needed a boost and this casserole is a great addition When I think of casserole I think of meat starch and probably a canned soup gravy This dish tastes much more complicated than that The bone in skin on chicken thighs make for tasty chicken The sauce is rich but easy to digest The herbs and celery add depth of flavor With the addition of potatoes and mushrooms you have a one dish meal I served mine with steamed asparagus and crusty french bread Well worth the time required to chop and dice Yum

0.0	0.0	Per usual this recipe did not disappoint The chicken was moist the potatoes were perfect and the sauce was just the right kind of rich I made a few convenient adjustments I used dried thyme i didn t have rosemary we don t like celery and I thickened the sauce after baking with a cornstarch slurry I made it all up in a skillet but transferred to a baking dish The removed the chicken transferred the sauce back to the skillet and added the cream and then thickened Thanks for another great meal Posted pics on insta
