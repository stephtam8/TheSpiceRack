0.0	0.0	This was delicious I made a couple of small additions after reading the reviews I used boneless skinless breasts instead of thighs and they needed additonal cooking time I seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and italian seasonings before browning After adding the broth and dijon I put the chicken back into the pan covered the pan and cooked on medium low for 10 minutes before adding the 0rzo I added a tsp of hot sauce into the broth and squeezed 1 2 lemon over the top before serving I used both shitake and baby bellas I will defintely make this again

0.0	0.0	I was really excited to make this for the family today Maybe I didn t season the chicken with enough S P but the chicken did not come out very good and too cold by the time I had the orzo ready The orzo and veggies did come out really well though and I kicked back the chicken stock and did add more orzo 1 1 4 cups so that it wouldn t be so liquify Overall a good dish but would probably grill the chicken like Chungah did in here IG video for better flavor

0.0	0.0	I made this with frozen sliced mixed mushrooms white cremini shitake portabello and half of a yellow onion because 1 I forgot the shallots insert facepalm and 2 I really wanted the mushrooms to be organic and that was all I could find I wasn t sure it was going to work out b c the frozen mushrooms created a lot of liquid and basically deglazed the pan earlier than I think was intended Regardless the flavor ended up being stunning I LOVED that this recipe uses a lot less dairy than I ve seen in similar recipes It created a creaminess without creating so much weight in our stomachs Also the flavor was stunning before the dairy so really you could make it without the cream and Parmesan if you wanted to The spinach ended up a bit slimy so I might try some dinosaur kale next time to keep that green flavor without that texture That s the only reason I gave this four stars instead of five On the whole I m thrilled with this recipe Thank you so much for sharing it

0.0	0.0	PJ if you are a regular here then you would know that ANY recipe can easily have substitutions chicken thighs can for the most part be swapped for breasts but you would just need to consider the meat wouldn t be as tender as the thighs but easily substituted OR try another protein of your choice To Jana s point you are not the only one on this blog we all enjoy different things hence substitutions and experimentation are a great way to make a recipe our own To the 4 amazing women that are taking the time to test experiment re test and publish these recipes THANK YOU

0.0	0.0	This is easy and yummy I used unsalted chicken stock and would not use any additional salt except for seasoning the chicken before cooking End result was about too salty for my taste I would also use milk instead of heavy cream it s creamy enough I ll be sharing this and will make it again This is definitely a recipe that you can play around with to suit your palette
