0.0	0.0	This is really a flavorful unique treatment for pot roast I have very finicky family members who normally don t like something a little different but I screwed up my courage and tried this on them anyway and they raved about it Now this is how I have to make pot roast with them I really like the tangy flavor from the pepperoni and the dry herb mixture The crusty bread suggestion is on point and I usually also throw some small potatoes carrots green beans and shallots In olive oil in a foil wrapped grill basket and have an amazing weekend feast This is a great take on pot roast really cool flavor profile one of the very best I ve come across

0.0	0.0	I love 99 9 percent of DD recipes but this one missed the mark The quantity of dried dill seriously overpowered the dish I think that if the dill was reduced by half this roast would be excellent and I love dill a lot		
0.0	0.0	Otherwise cooking times were spot on texture was what I expect from a Mississippi roast I made this exactly as written and other than the dill problem I would try it again with modifications
