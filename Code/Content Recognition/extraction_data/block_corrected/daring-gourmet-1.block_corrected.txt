0.0	0.0	WHAT IS ROUGH PUFF PASTRY		
0.0	0.0	Rough puff pastry is exactly that rough In other words it s not quite as delicate or as intricately layered as traditional puff pastry but it s still pretty darn amazing and is also vastly less work Classic puff pastry takes several hours to make compared to about 30 minutes of active prep time not counting the freezing time to make rough puff pastry		
0.0	0.0	Unlike classic puff pastry where you roll a large solid slab of butter into the dough rough puff pastry dices the butter into small 1 2 inch pieces and incorporates it that way Advocates of this method maintain that using the larger chunks of butter produces a flakier end result An alternative method involves pulsing the butter and flour in a food processor to get coarse crumbs similar to making pie crust Both methods work well and you can choose either one		
0.0	0.0	In short rough puff pastry is easier and quicker to make than classic puff pastry and works beautifully for any recipe calling for puff pastry		
0.0	0.0	Can You Freeze Rough Puff Pastry
