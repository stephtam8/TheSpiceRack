0.0	0.0	Sweet Potato Pie vs Pumpkin Pie		
0.0	0.0	Sweet potato or pumpkin That s an ongoing debate that s probably rooted more in culture and upbringing than anything it comes down to where you re from and what you grew up with But those on the side of of sweet potato insist that the flavor is much richer than pumpkin and I agree Think about it Plain pumpkin on its own isn t nearly as flavorful as eating a sweet potato and that translates over into pie as well		
0.0	0.0	Beyond having a richer flavor than pumpkin sweet potato is also more nutritious It has more vitamins minerals protein and fiber And even though we re talking about a sugary dessert it s still nice to know it has some redeeming qualities right If it helps curb some of the guilt I m in		
0.0	0.0	Another plus for sweet potato pie is the convenience factor Using canned pumpkin or canned sweet potatoes is certainly an option but nothing beats fresh And grabbing a couple of sweet potatoes and throwing them in the oven is far more convenient than buying a whole pumpkin digging out the seeds and then baking it Plus sweet potatoes are available year round		
0.0	0.0	To make this sweet potato pie extra delicious we re adding a special ingredient Sour cream This old fashioned trick helps round out the flavors and makes for an especially rich and velvety smooth texture You re gonna love it

0.0	0.0	Scrub the sweet potatoes and wrap them in foil We re going to bake not boil them That way none of the nutrients are lost in the water and it also keeps the flesh drier so the pie doesn t border on runny		
0.0	0.0	When the potatoes are done let them cool until you can handle them this can also be done well in advance The peels will come off easily Discard the peels Place the sweet potato in a large mixing bowl and set aside

0.004739336492890996	0.0	Kimberly how wonderful to see you submit a Sweet Potato pie I have always preferred Sweet potato pie too Pumpkin probably because as you say it comes down to culture and what you grew up with You re right As an African American from the South we always had at least 4 6 fresh hot Sweet potato pies every Sunday 7 of us kids 3 being boys my dad you get the picture We never tired of these pies And it is the reason I really learned to bake When I left the South and moved up north on on my own I was very disappointed that even among my culture people here didn t make this pie according to my liking I finally called my mother acquired her recipe and since passed this on to my own daughter Your recipe sounds wonderful and is the first that I ve seen that includes many of my Mom s ingredients except she wouldn t use ginger and in the place of the sour cream she always used carnation milk and Butter Butter in Sweet Potato Pie is a MUST It provides a full body richness and flavor to the Pie without being overbearing Aside from that your pie sounds marvelous Thanks again	cream
