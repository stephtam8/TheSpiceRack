0.0	0.0	The Ultimate Green Bean Casserole Recipe		
0.0	0.0	This recipe begins by frying up bacon along with onions mushrooms and garlic Next we make a roux with butter and flour which will not only serve as a thickener for the cream sauce but will add wonderful depth of flavor Next we pour in the cream followed by that glorious white cheddar and watch it melt into a rich luxuriously delicious sauce Fresh green beans are then folded in the sauce the mixture is poured into a casserole dish and topped with crispy crunchy utterly irresistible French fried onions It s baked until bubbly and oozing and then served at the table where it will completely disappear every last drop of it within minutes

0.0	0.0	I found this recipe many years ago when I was asked to make GBC for Thanksgiving Growing up I hated this casserole I was never a fan of the canned cream of mushroom soup it is not good I m also a big fan of making things from scratch they taste so much better I found this recipe and was excited to try it It was such a huge success that it is requested every year for both Thanksgiving and Christmas I love it and there is rarely any left over I omit the mushrooms because of a family members food allergy I love mushrooms however they are not missed I add extra bacon because we love bacon and anything with bacon is amazing This recipe is a must try You will not be disappointed

0.0	0.0	I would recommend turkey bacon and extra butter Make sure to cook the turkey bacon in some butter to pow up the flavor You could also try sausage if that is an option I would go for sage sausage if you went that route Other than that I m not sure what else could substitute I think having no mushrooms would def alter flavor but my sister is dating a mushroom hater and they just add more chicken flavoring to hide the deficit

0.0	0.0	This recipe for green bean casserole looks awesome That being said I use chopped Spanish chorizo in my green bean casserole Don t use the Mexican chorizo which is like fresh sausage and is very greasy Spanish chorizo on the other hand is dried and smoked and ready to eat right out of the package I also try to keep it low carbohydrate use light cream and fresh mushrooms instead of canned cream of mushroom soup which tends to have added thickeners and is high in carbohydrates and sodium As for the onions caramelized onions are better than those dried onion rings used in ordinary green bean casserole If you like shredded or grated Parmesan cheese on the top

0.0	0.0	I have searched high and low for a green bean casserole that meets and exceeds my wildest casserole dreams and this is it Most of the recipes I use are sourced from Bon Appetit Ina Garten and the New York Times however I have tried many versions of their GBC over the years and they just didn t do the trick this recipe does I followed the recipe exactly as written using extremely high quality ingredients with one exception I omitted the mushrooms as I strongly dislike them Instead neurotically I added additional 12 ounces of bacon and onions yes I used a scale to account for the absence of the mushrooms I also sauteed the onions slowly for a little longer than suggested to caramelize them add an additional depth of flavor The end result was out of this world If you are looking for a GBC look no further because this is absolutely it

0.009009009009009009	0.0	Hi Kasey I would probably make 4 batches and I would make them a day in advance minus the French fried onions Prepare the casseroles as instructed to the point where you pour the mixture into the baking dishes then cover with foil and refrigerate until you re ready to bake them Then take them out of the fridge and let them sit at room temp for 30 60 minutes to warm up a bit then add the French fried onions and bake as instructed You should be able to fit two casseroles on two oven racks for a total of 4 or if you have a double oven even better	sit

0.0	0.0	Hi Jeff yes the onions will lose their crunch If it s an option to precook the casserole at home and then add the onions and bake it for a few minutes once you get to your in laws house that would be ideal If not this casserole is still going to be the star of the show even if the onions lose their crunch

0.0	0.0	I was never a fan of green bean casserole but it was a holiday staple in my boyfriend s house and I knew it was something that I would always have to make even though I wouldn t be eating it For Easter this past year I decided to look for a recipe sans condensed cream of mushroom soup and stumbled upon this one I m a vegetarian so I used Quorn veggie bacon cooked in some olive oil with some smoked salt thrown in When it was time to load up my plate I got a heaping of everything else and the smallest serving of green bean casserole you ve ever seen Once I tasted it I knew I would be heading back for seconds IT WAS SO GOOD My boyfriend loved it more than the kind his mom made which is always such a compliment My whole family enjoyed it While my boyfriend was happy that I liked it I think he was a little bummed that he had to share the leftovers with me I made this again last night without onion as I didn t have one on hand and the flavor was still amazing I never comment on recipes but I just had to share how much I enjoy this one

0.0	0.0	Hi I am making this for TG but I am wondering will the green beans cook more in the oven so they aren t crunchy My family likes them soft so if they will still be crispy can I just boil them longer before blanching Also if I use shallots instead of onions do I use the same amount

0.0	0.0	Hi Wendy I wouldn t describe them as crunchy but they re not squishy soft either Yes they do continue to cook more in the oven If you don t like even the tiniest bit of crunch to your beans then to play it safe go ahead and boil them a little longer You can use shallots if you prefer Shallots are sweeter and milder hence commonly used raw for salads dressings etc so no problem with using an equivalent amount

0.0	0.0	Love this recipe as an excellent alternative to canned soups I tried this in a slow cooker to see if I could make the recipe feed the masses doubled the answer is no Bake it in the oven You could MORE than likely fit a doubled recipe into a 9 13 pyrex glass dish and bake The slow cooker ruins the texture and consistency of the casserole steam and uneven cooking Great recipe otherwise the bacon and white cheddar add a decadent extra layer that is otherwise missing from this traditionally canned soup casserole Take it easy on the saute heat I burned the bacon and onion doing something else in the pan and while it tasted great it took on an unpleasant color when the liquids were added and the pan was deglazed

0.0	0.0	Hi Leia Absolutely you can use cornstarch instead of flour It will only slightly alter the flavor you won t be getting the nice flavor from the butter flour roux but it will still taste 100 awesome So use 1 2 the amount of cornstarch as you would flour and skip the part where it says to whisk it in with the butter You can still melt the butter butter makes everything taste better but then mix the cornstarch in with the chicken broth until dissolved and simply pour the half and half and chicken stock cornstarch mix into the pan with the melted butter and then whisk to combine and thicken as it simmers Happy Thanksgiving and let us know what you all thought of the casserole

0.0	0.0	This recipe was a complete success The first time I made it I didn t have quite enough of this and had a little too much of that and it came out fantastic anyways It was so popular that it was immediately requested again three days later I get my green beans from an Asian market as they are generally higher quality than the Walmart variety when the finished product is done However they require more cleaning and much more aggressive end removal		
0.0	0.0	So I wound up making this in huge batches and freezing up to 4 casseroles for a month s worth This works really well as long as the mushrooms are fully cooked I let the pre green bean mushroom soup simmer longer than given I leave the onion topping off until right before they go into the oven As long as it s fully defrosted the cooking times are the same if not shorter We haven t been able to notice any decrease in quality and this is practically a meal in and of itself		
0.0	0.0	We tend to do batch cooking on a few days out of the month and I was so happy that we could do it with this My sister has always been a green bean casserole fiend but her husband hated them This recipe went over equally well with both I was so excited to find this website as well we are looking forward to trying all sorts of your other recipes
