0.0	0.0	Consistently rated THE best slow cooker pot roast recipe we ll show you everything you need to create the most flavorful and mouthwateringly delicious pot roast EVER		
0.0	0.0	I can t think of anything better than coming home to the smell of a roast wafting through the house beckoning it s dinner time And this one is exceptionally flavorful and delicious		
0.0	0.0	The smell of a cooking roast is nostalgic to me It s said that smell is more closely linked to memory than any of the other five senses The smell of freshly baked bread might trigger memories of grandma s kitchen the scent of cologne or perfume a romantic encounter the odor of mothballs a great aunt s house the stench of stale carpet those penny pinching college dorm days Whatever the association might be smell is a powerful thing And not that this has anything to do with pot roast but I thought it was interesting so I ll throw it in here anyway From Psychology Today		
0.0	0.0	The actual ability to smell is highly linked to memory Research has shown that when areas of the brain connected to memory are damaged the ability to identify smells is actually impaired In order to identify a scent you must remember when you have smelled it before and then connect it to visual information that occurred at the same time According to some research studying information in the presence of an odor actually increases the vividness and intensity of that remembered information when you smell that odor again

0.0	0.0	Okay back to the Pot Roast For eating purposes that is		
0.0	0.0	For me roasts are associated with Sunday Growing up at home and still in my own home today roasts were always ideal to serve on Sundays A couple of hours at church including travel meant just the right amount of time to be able to place everything in a timed oven or a slow cooker before leaving and then come home to a ready meal My mom would often already have the potatoes peeled in advance and covered with water in a stock pot so when we got home starving and ready to eat all she had to do was boil the potatoes prepare another vegetable and thicken the gravy And before long we were seated at the table as a family enjoying great food and family bonding time

0.0	0.0	I know your tummies are rumbling so let s get that roast a cookin		
0.0	0.0	But before we do let me stress one thing I learned from my mom about cooking roasts Probably THE single most important factor to the flavor of the finished roast is to fry it until it s very browned on all sides before cooking it That is the KEY to a deliciously flavorful roast so whatever you do don t skip that step And don t be afraid to get it good and browned Not only will it greatly enhance the flavor of the roast itself but all those burnt bits on the bottom of the pan is what will give the gravy that irresistibly wonderful flavor		
0.0	0.0	Okay let s get started		
0.0	0.0	First prepare the rub by combining all of the pot roast seasoning spices herbs together		
0.0	0.0	Rub rub rub that roast down on all sides using every last bit of that spice rub		
0.0	0.0	Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven I use and love Lodge or heavy skillet and liberally brown the roast on all sides		
0.0	0.0	Remove the roast and place it in the slow cooker I use and love my Hamilton Beach Stay or Go 7 Qt Slow Cooker I ve been using it regularly for the past 8 years and it s still working as good as new		
0.0	0.0	Add the broth to the Dutch oven and bring it to a boil scraping up the burnt bits on the bottom of the pan that s called deglazing for those of you who don t know Add the tomato paste red wine if using and salt and return it to a boil for a couple of minutes stirring to combine		
0.0	0.0	Place the carrots celery onions and garlic around the sides and on top of the roast in the slow cooker		
0.0	0.0	Add the bay leavers and place the strips of bacon on top I don t usually add bacon but I did this time I thought why not As the ancient Chinese proverb goes There isn t anything so good that bacon won t make it even better		
0.0	0.0	Pour the beef broth mixture over the pot roast		
0.0	0.0	Cook on high for 3 4 hours or on low for 8 9 hours		
0.0	0.0	If you have the time I highly recommend cooking it on low for 8 9 hours for an ultra flavorful tender roast		
0.0	0.0	Pour the liquid from the slow cooker into a medium stock pot leaving the roast and vegetables in the warm slow cooker		
0.0	0.0	To make the gravy

0.0	0.0	Add salt and pepper to taste		
0.0	0.0	Place the roast on a serving platter and spoon the vegetables around it Discard the bay leaves and bacon Pour a little of the gravy over the roast it looks nicer that way and serve the pot roast with the extra gravy some potatoes and veggies of your choice

0.0	0.0	Hi Margie wonderful Yes chuck roast is much higher in fat But something I always remind everyone is that research has finally confirmed once and for all that FAT IS NOT BAD for you in any way and is not linked to heart disease at all The only fat that s bad is trans fat Our ancestors have always known this but it took us unfortunately several decades to finally reaffirm that after medical science led us all astray back in the 40 s Thanks goodness the facts have finally been set straight So enjoy every bite of that pot roast knowing you re nourishing your body with healthy fats

0.0	0.0	Hi Cynthia tomato paste is more concentrated in flavor and of course is smooth not chunky but you can use crushed tomatoes in a pinch I would not however use chili powder completely different flavor than paprika not remotely the same thing I would recommend holding off until you have the paprika and the bacon both make a huge difference in the flavor Cooking it in the oven I would aim for 3 4 hours until fork tender at 275 F

0.0	0.0	Hello Eva and welcome I m so happy to hear you enjoyed the pot roast My mother usually cooks it in the oven as well and I rotate between the oven and the slow cooker depending on when I m cooking it and how soon I need it to be ready I am thrilled to meet another Hungarian What I ve learned about Hungarian cuisine I learned through my travels to Hungary from my brother who used to live there and is a good cook and from Hungarian friends There are always variations to even the most traditional meals in any country and everyone has their own way of doing things I would love to hear about yours and some of your tips and tricks I LOVE to learn new things especially when it comes to cooking Thanks so much for your feedback on the roast and hope you will visit again and again

0.0	0.0	Hi Bridget Wonderful A bother NEVER Low setting is about 200 F and high setting is about 300 F My mother usually cooks the roast in the oven in a covered roast pan or a Römertopf clay pot I m not sure but I think she probably cooks it closer to the high setting 300 F for a few hours The low setting in a slow cooker is great to use when you re going to be gone all day you can start cooking it in the morning and have it done by the time you get home And it s SUPER tender I think I cooked this particular roast overnight on low and then kept it warm the next morning until lunch Enjoy

0.0	0.0	Your pot roast looks amazing But I have to know please what cut of roast did you use for the one you made that shows in the picture I m not a fan of chuck and the one you made looks like everything I want not fatty shreds apart I want to make this recipe and don t want to be disappointed with the cut of meat itself Any advice would be greatly appreciated Thank you

0.0	0.0	Hi Linda First of all thank you for the compliment My preference is the same as yours I m not a fan of pot roasts that are really fatty I just like a good tender lean cut of beef I m pretty sure that for this particular roast I used either a round roast or bottom round roast the latter can be slightly more fatty but is still pretty lean Thank you for visiting and I hope you re happy with the results of this pot roast

0.0	0.0	Hi okay so I followed most of these instructions However I used a eye of the round roast I had to omit the celery because my hubby hates celery I did sear the roast then I decided to sauté just a bit my onion garlic when degassing the pan Since I didn t have red wine I put 3 cups of broth and also omitted the salt It is what we are having for dinner tonight so crossing my fingers and toes it s good Smells awesome already and it s only been in the pot for 15 mins thanks Sherrieg Toronto I will let you know the outcome
