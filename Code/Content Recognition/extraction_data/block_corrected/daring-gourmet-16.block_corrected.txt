0.0	0.0	How to Smoke a Ham		
0.0	0.0	Whether smoking your own ham is something that s been on your bucket list or is something you ve been curious about it s time to give it a go While it may seem a little intimidating smoking ham is actually very easy and straightforward you just need to follow the proper techniques We ll show you everything you need to know on how to smoke a raw ham also called a green ham as well as how to smoke a pre cooked ham		
0.0	0.0	Smoking a Raw Ham Versus a Pre Cooked Ham		
0.0	0.0	Whether you re using a raw ham aka green ham or a pre cooked ham will determine the method While the smoking part is identical except for the length of time the main difference lies in the curing process pre cooked ham has already been cured so you can skip that part and move directly on to the smoking part		
0.0	0.0	How to Smoke a Pre Cooked Ham		
0.0	0.0	The process is the same as smoking a raw ham see below you just skip the brining process and the smoking time will be shorter Instead you will only smoke the ham reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees to warm the ham through and infuse it with smoke Keep in mind that the ham is already pre cooked so be careful not to exceed 140 F or your ham will be dry		
0.0	0.0	Note that pre cooked hams are usually already smoked so in smoking it again you ll be giving it a double dose of smoke Don t worry that the smoke flavor will be too overwhelming it won t Especially with the glaze added The extra layer of smoke will only enhance the overall flavor and make it all the more delicious		
0.0	0.0	How to Smoke a Raw Ham		
0.0	0.0	This is where the real fun is In selecting your fresh ham leg and curing and smoking it from scratch you have full control over the quality of your finished ham		
0.0	0.0	The first step is to cure the ham Curing the ham draws moisture out of the meat enables the salt and flavors of the brine to penetrate the meat gives the ham a great flavor and enables it to retain its color Prague powder curing salt 1 is critical for the latter Bypassing this process will just give you cooked pork with a cooked pork flavor versus the appearance and flavor of ham		
0.0	0.0	To cure the ham you will need to prepare a brine place the ham in the brine and allow it so sit or cure for 7 days that s about one day per pound of meat		
0.0	0.0	The brine will infuse the ham with flavor as it slowly penetrates the ham over the course of a week For this reason using a rub later on is somewhat redundant Plus unlike the brine the flavors from the rub will not penetrate into the meat while it s smoking they will simply remain on the surface You can still apply a rub if you wish but it isn t necessary Between the brine the smoke and the glaze your ham will be wonderfully flavorful

0.0	0.0	Hi Rusty the curing salt serves two purposes It adds a layer of safety during the low temp slow smoking process inhibits the growth of bacteria and it s also what keeps the meat a nice pink color You don t have to use it you can simply omit it but the result won t look like a typical ham it will be brown like the color of pork roast

0.0	0.0	Thanks for another really great recipe Kimberly I was wondering if you might comment on whether this is also how the traditional Black Forest Hams from Germany are created and if not would you please consider possibly documenting such a recipe I ve been told that traditionally Black Forest Hams are cold smoked but have no ideas as to whether or not this is true Thanks again Kimberly and all the best to you and your family

0.0	0.0	Thank you Ron That s correct Black Forest Ham is cold smoked and is a very different product than regular ham Black Forest ham is a dry cured ham it isn t cooked it goes through a long process where it s hung up and cures in a temperature and humidity controlled environment where the moisture is drawn out over the course of a few months At the end of the process it s cold smoked for several weeks given a dose of smoke flavor without cooking the ham traditionally over pine fir juniper wood and then very thinly sliced It s similar to Italian prosciutto or Spanish jamon but smoked
