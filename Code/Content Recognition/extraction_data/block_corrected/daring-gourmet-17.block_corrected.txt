0.0	0.0	Nutritious and delicious simple and quick to make you ll understand why Italian Wedding Soup has been an Italian American classic for so many generations		
0.0	0.0	Served at every Italian American wedding across the nation Italian Wedding Soup is something no self respecting Italian American couple would ever think of getting married without it		
0.0	0.0	Okay that s not true In fact this soup has absolutely nothing to do with weddings		
0.0	0.0	But that doesn t change the fact that it s superbly delicious Nor should you let it stop you from serving it at your wedding should you feel so inclined		
0.0	0.0	So then why the name Italian Wedding Soup		
0.0	0.0	Where Did Italian Wedding Soup Originate		
0.0	0.0	The term wedding soup comes from the Italian minestra maritata married soup referring to the flavor produced by the marriage or perfect blending of greens broth and meat		
0.0	0.0	This soup enjoys a long rich heritage though very different from the Italian Wedding Soup we know today Its origin isn t clear but it s thought to date back to ancient Rome and then made its way to Toledo Spain a gorgeous city we visited last Summer image below The soup s Spanish ancestor was a heavier one incorporating a variety of meats that were slow simmered with vegetables and without the addition of pasta an expensive commodity at that time		
0.0	0.0	From Spain the soup was introduced to Naples Italy second image below where they too used any combination of meats such as beef pork ribs sausages and ham hocks to create a rich meat broth The Neapolitans made it their own with the addition of ancient greens like torzella escarole puntarelle chicory and savoy cabbage Just as it was in Spain the minestra maritata was a peasant soup using whatever leftover meats and wild greens they had on hand		
0.0	0.0	The soup eventually made its way from Naples to America via Italian immigrants who replaced the long simmered cuts of meat with meatballs and used onions generally one type of leafy green vegetable and added pasta And it came to be called Italian Wedding Soup		
0.0	0.0	The earliest known reference to wedding soup in American print is an article in the Los Angeles Times from 1925 written by Joseph Musso of Hollywood s oldest restaurant The Musso Frank Grill wherein he described the process of making Wedding Soup It has since remained perhaps the most iconic Italian American soup and can be found in nearly every Italian restaurant across the nation		
0.0	0.0	This soup s Italian and Spanish ancestors used the process of low and slow simmering meats to achieve a great broth as the base of their soups In this Italian American version of using meatballs that step isn t possible You would have to make a separate batch of broth using whole bone in chicken and vegetables And using high quality broth is really the key to a great Italian Wedding Soup		
0.0	0.0	I definitely don t always have several hours to make my own chicken broth every time I need it as the base for a soup And one of things I love about Italian Wedding Soup besides its exquisite flavor is how otherwise quick and easy it is to make So for this special soup I m enlisting the help of my favorite broth from Aneto		
0.0	0.0	Aneto is the most unique broth manufacturer in the world because they make broth the way you make it at home Using fresh vegetables whole chicken nothing else and then slow simmering it for hours for maximum flavor and nutrition		
0.0	0.0	Based outside of Barcelona Spain we toured their factory last year and it was one of the most inspiring experiences we ve ever had Really you have to see it for yourself to understand why Check out our article about our experience touring the Aneto broth factory

0.0	0.0	I made this soup for an Italian Pasta Party and boy was it wonderful I tweaked the recipe by using seasoned bread crumbs and adding two little tubs of Knorr Homestyle Chicken Stock with 4 cups of water The recipe made 65 little meatballs and the flavors were delicious I would definitely make this again and again My husband asked me to make another pot of this soup for only us The only problem I had was finding the ancini di pepe pasta It took five stores until I found it but it was worth it and really made the soup Thank you so much for developing this delicious recipe
