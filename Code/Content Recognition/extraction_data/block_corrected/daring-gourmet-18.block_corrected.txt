0.0	0.0	Let me tell you this roasted pumpkin hummus ROCKS		
0.0	0.0	The first time I made this was several years ago when my kids were 3 and 5 years old and at the time I only got to taste just enough to know it was going to be a hit Here s what happened		
0.0	0.0	I had just made the kids a healthy lunch and they were sitting down to eat and thought I d have some of this Roasted Pumpkin Hummus that I had whipped up just an hour earlier As soon as they saw me eating this hummus they asked me what it was and could they try some They each took one bite pushed their lunch plates aside and eagerly asked for more		
0.0	0.0	Now normally I would have said something like eat your lunch first and then you can have some But I realized that this nutrition packed hummus was probably even healthier than their actual lunch so I consented		
0.0	0.0	And that was the end of my lunch because my two little kids went to town on this polishing off the whole thing		
0.0	0.0	The next day I was smarter		
0.0	0.0	I doubled the batch		
0.0	0.0	This delicious hummus is packed with nutrition featuring healthy fresh pumpkin that s roasted for a deeper and richer flavor garbanzo beans tahini paste garlic and olive oil
