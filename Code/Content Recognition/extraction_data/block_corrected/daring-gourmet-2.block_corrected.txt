0.0	0.0	A thoroughly authentic Christmas Pudding recipe also known as Plum Pudding and Figgy Pudding It s the perfect make ahead dessert as the flavors only get better over time A household favorite for centuries no traditional Christmas is complete without a Christmas Pudding		
0.0	0.0	What is Figgy Pudding Plum Pudding Christmas Pudding		
0.0	0.0	If you re familiar with the figgy pudding Christmas carol We Wish You a Merry Christmas you may have asked yourself at some point what is a figgy pudding anyway		
0.0	0.0	All three of these names refer to a traditional English steamed cake like dessert comprised of breadcrumbs flour suet sugar eggs brandy lemon zest candied citrus peel spices and dried fruits specifically raisins currants and golden raisins With respect to the different names the short answer is that figgy pudding can be considered a much earlier precursor of plum pudding and they ve both come to be referred to as Christmas pudding		
0.0	0.0	Figgy pudding dates back to the 14th century and was a much different dish than what we refer to as figgy pudding today It was more of a wet sticky thick porridge consisting of boiled figs water wine ground almonds raisins and honey It later evolved into incorporating ground meat and grains and then later still evolved into a steamed pudding that was made with raisins		
0.0	0.0	Where does the term plum pudding come from Plums were what the pre Victorians called raisins and dried fruits in general and the name stuck		
0.0	0.0	It wasn t until 1845 when it first came to be called Christmas Pudding in Eliza Acton s bestselling cookbook Modern Cookery for Private Families		
0.0	0.0	And so we have three names that are still used in different regions of the English speaking world In the U S it is more commonly called Figgy Pudding whereas in the UK and Ireland it is more commonly known as Christmas Pudding or simply pud or Plum Pudding		
0.0	0.0	As with many traditional Christmas desserts plum pudding incorporates symbolism reflective of Christ such as the holly representing the crown of thorns and setting the pudding on fire representing the passion of Christ		
0.0	0.0	How Far in Advance Should I Make Christmas Pudding		
0.0	0.0	As with other Christmas goodies that are mean to be made in advance in order to allow their flavors to develop e g Stollen Printen Springerle Speculoos etc Christmas pudding was traditionally made several weeks before Christmas The brandy acts as both a preservative and draws out more flavor from the other ingredients So generally the longer the pudding matures the more flavorful it will be		
0.0	0.0	In the UK Christmas pudding was traditionally prepared on what is known as stir up Sunday the last Sunday before Advent typically the last Sunday in November or 5 weeks before Christmas This was day the pudding ingredients would be assembled and stirred up and then steamed in pudding basins A popular tradition was to add a silver coin six pence to the pudding batter and whoever found the coin in their serving would have good luck Once cooked and cooled down the puddings would be carefully wrapped and stored in the basement until ready for serving on Christmas		
0.0	0.0	Can I Omit the Alcohol		
0.0	0.0	The brandy serves as a preservative for prolonging the shelf life of the pudding and also draws out more flavor from the ingredients as the pudding matures You can omit the brandy if you prefer but the pudding will need to be stored in the fridge and consumed within a week		
0.0	0.0	How Long Should You Steam Figgy Pudding		
0.0	0.0	You ll see different recipes recommending different times anything from 3 hours to 8 hours There s really no right or wrong to this but if you are using suet which is traditional and we highly recommend it you ll need to steam it for at least 4 hours preferably longer as it takes suet a long time to break down and to create the air pockets that gives desserts their characteristically light and soft texture		
0.0	0.0	The longer you steam the pudding the darker it will become more closely resembling the pictures of traditional plum pudding you ve seen If you want that traditional dark brown color steam it for 8 hours		
0.0	0.0	It is very difficult to over steam a pudding so if you re uncertain just keep steaming until your pudding is a rich dark color		
0.0	0.0	How Long Does Plum Pudding Keep		
0.0	0.0	Three elements are key to a lengthy storage time The alcohol and sugar content preservatives and proper storage The pudding needs to be wrapped very tightly and stored in a cool place that is fairly dry but with enough humidity to keep the pudding from drying out The ideal and traditional storage space is a basement or cellar As long as it is cool but not freezing a balcony or sheltered area outside out of sunlight will work too If you do not have a cool dark environment in your home you can keep it in the fridge but make sure it is tightly wrapped in two layers of plastic wrap and some aluminum foil to prevent it from drying out		
0.0	0.0	Properly stored plum pudding will keep for several weeks Traditionally it would even be stored for several months even as long as a year or more though that makes me a bit nervous You can also freeze the pudding for up to a year Make sure it is well wrapped in two layers of plastic wrap then aluminum foil then place it in a freezer bag or airtight container		
0.0	0.0	How to Reheat and Serve Christmas Pudding		
0.0	0.0	After your pudding is done maturing and you re ready to serve it unwrap it place it back in the pudding mold cover and re steam it for 30 60 minutes or until heated through Alternatively you can cover and microwave the pudding		
0.0	0.0	The traditional way to serve the pudding is to pour some more brandy over it and set it on fire letting the fire burn down and then serve it with Hard Sauce also known as Brandy Butter in the UK Though hard sauce is traditional you can also serve it with a dusting of confectioner s sugar some whipped cream brandy sauce vanilla custard ice cream or lemon sauce		
0.0	0.0	How to Light a Christmas Pudding		
0.0	0.0	To set your Christmas pudding on fire pour some brandy 3 4 tablespoons into a soup ladle Hold the ladle over a flame tipping it slightly to allow the brandy to catch the flame Once the brandy is on fire slowly pour the flaming ladle over the top of the pudding the fire will transfer to the pudding Wait for the fire to naturally extinguish and then serve the pudding		
0.0	0.0	Traditionally the pudding is brought to the table the lights are turned off and the pudding is set on fire for everyone to see

0.0	0.0	It s called Stir up Sunday because in The Common Prayer Book used in Anglican Churches one of the prayers on that day the last Sunday before Advent begins Stir up we beseech thee oh Lord Also on the subject of keeping it s traditional for many British families to make a pudding one year fir consumption the next And given that cellars are less common as they once were they re just well wrapped in as you suggest clingfilm and foil and placed at the back of a cupboard to slowly age and mature allowing the flavours to develop Maybe we just use even more brandy to aid the preservation but there s no need to be nervous Great writing and a great recipe
