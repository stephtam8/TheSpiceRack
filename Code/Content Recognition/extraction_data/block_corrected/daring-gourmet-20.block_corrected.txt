0.0	0.0	These homemade marinated olives are a real show stopper Plump juicy and packed full of flavor they re perfect for entertaining snacking including at the dinner table or giving away as a thoughtful classy gift		
0.0	0.0	I don t know when or how it started but olives are almost always present for any family dinners involving my parents Any time my parents come over for dinner my dad always brings a jar of olives It s almost mechanical Dad walks in the door is buried by the grandkids reaches in his bag pulls out the olives and hands them to me I empty them into a small serving bowl and put them on the dinner table And we have olives for dinner regardless of what s being served As far as my dad is concerned no dinner is complete without them And should he forget to bring them the predictable comment that follows Oh nuts I forgot the olives And occasionally there s the antiquated expletive cockeyed sprinkled in there too My dad s pretty serious about his olives		
0.0	0.0	This tradition in recent years has extended to olives as gifts If we re traveling somewhere my husband and I will often pick up some gourmet marinated olives to bring back for my dad And so it finally hit me this year why not make my own I got excited at thought of having several jars of different flavored marinated olives proudly stashed in our pantry to get out for those family dinners give to my dad as a thank you for babysitting our kids on date night and for giving away to friends as gifts		
0.0	0.0	And speaking of gifts did I mention they make the perfect gift		
0.0	0.0	Whether from A Christmas Carol It s a Wonderful Life or any other such heart warming classic we ve all grown up with the sentiment that giving is more rewarding than receiving And that s especially true when the gift is from the heart when it involves a little more than going to the store laying down some money and tossing an item in the shopping bag to take home Not that we don t appreciate gifts like that we do we do but most of us have experienced how nice it is to receive a simple gift that was thoughtfully prepared by the giver The time and effort that goes into making the gift speaks love and thoughtfulness more than money handed to a cashier At least it does to me And so whatever other store bought gifts I may be giving to the friends and family I always like to include something homemade		
0.0	0.0	And doesn t everyone enjoy good food		
0.0	0.0	Here is a visually beautiful deliciously tasty and elegant gift you can easily put together for your friends family co workers or neighbors Gourmet marinated olives come with a hefty price tag in specialty stores or at the deli but these you can make for a fraction of the cost and they taste simply divine		
0.0	0.0	And I can t think of anything more classy to give than a jar of beautifully vibrant plump marinated olives can you Olives are gourmet healthy they taste amazing and your friends will think you re a person of impeccable taste and class You ll enjoy the response you get as you give these delightful olives to the people you care about And you ll love the feeling of personal fulfillment that you ll experience		
0.0	0.0	Just spoon some olives into canning jars screw on the lids and for a little added homemade touch cover the lids with a square of material and tie with some twine		
0.0	0.0	For whatever purpose you make these olives they ll be a guaranteed hit Just be sure to make them in advance because they need to sit for a week before you use them in order to enjoy optimal flavor The longer they sit the better they ll taste		
0.0	0.0	We re going to use a combination of green black and kalamata olives for a nice array of color and flavor		
0.0	0.0	First a word about one of the ingredients Preserved Lemons Do you have to use them No Can you use some fresh lemon zest instead Of course But the flavor of preserved lemons is totally different Like in a movie if the olives are the star the preserved lemon is the co star The magical depth of mellow citrus flavor that these preserved lemons impart to the olives cannot be overstated They re simply amazing They re ridiculously easy to make yourself it just requires some advance planning because they need to sit for at least 3 weeks before you use them But don t despair I ve got you covered

0.0	0.0	Now let s make those scrumptious marinated olives		
0.0	0.0	Drain the olives You ll want to give the black olives a rinse so their juices don t discolor the other olives		
0.0	0.0	Look at that beautiful collection of plump multi colored olives Oh the possibilities		
0.0	0.0	You can really use any herbs and seasonings of your choice This time we re going to use fresh thyme rosemary coriander and fennel seeds bay leaves garlic a little dried red chili for some spiciness extra virgin olive oil and those wonderful preserved lemons		
0.0	0.0	Be sure to use good quality extra virgin olive oil as the flavor will greatly impact the outcome of the marinated olives		
0.0	0.0	To bring out the flavor of the coriander and fennel we re going to toast them		
0.0	0.0	First give them a quick smash in a ziplock bag just to crack them open Heat a small dry pan over medium high heat and once hot add the coriander and fennel seeds Roast until fragrant about 2 3 minutes shaking pan frequently towards the end Be careful not to scorch them		
0.0	0.0	Pour in the olive oil and let it heat up for just a minute then remove from the heat		
0.0	0.0	Add all the remaining ingredients and let the mixture sit for a few minutes until cooled down		
0.0	0.0	NOTE Unless you like super spicy food be very careful how much dried red chili you add A little goes a very long way and the spiciness only increases over time Omit entirely if you don t like heat		
0.0	0.0	Pour the marinade over the olives and stir to combine Cover and let sit in the fridge for at least a week before eating them The longer they sit the better they ll taste You can also go ahead and divide the olives into gift jars first and then store them in the fridge until ready to give away

0.0	0.0	Hi Kimberly thanks so much for the recipe One question for you though does the olive oil marinade need to cover the olives completely before they go in the fridge I followed the recipe closely and packed all of the olives in the marinade into a jar but the olive oil only makes it about a third of the way up the side of the jar leaving 2 3 of the olives not submerged in olive oil marinate Did I do something wrong Should I add more olive oil Would be grateful for your advice Thanks so much Kim
