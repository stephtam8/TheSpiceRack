0.0	0.0	Hi Rebekah if you make the marzipan with corn syrup or another liquid sweetener i e not egg white then they will last quite a while because there s nothing overly perishable in them I don t know exactly how long but at room temp I d say at least a week and in the fridge they ll last for several weeks

0.0	0.0	Thanks Sam Yes I would absolutely use glucose not egg white They should be just fine shipping and made with glucose will keep for quite a while in the fridge the shelf life of the almonds powdered sugar glucose and chocolate is pretty long

0.0	0.0	I m from Southern Germany as well and remember little Marzipan pigs I would buy as a girl around Christmastime I have a longtime friend of GERMAN heritage as well and we have made the little Marzipan fruits together which was so much fun and yummy to boot The last few years I have gone to a World Market store where they get the various Marzipan candies as well as the Stollen in 3 or 4 varieties and I have gotten them They weren t as fresh as I thought they might be and so this year I decided to google the Marzipan and Stollen and I happened to come across your wonderful site I was elated and excited to find a recipe and decided this was the year I would try my hand at making it I have the candied rinds and Marzipan made and will put the rest together in next couple of days I can t wait to see how the taste compares to the bought kind I m sure it will be so much better and I plan to make them next year as well as some of the candies for friends and family I was born in Germany and came to the States when I was 12 with my mother who had married a service man I am now 71 and it has taken me all these years to finally realize that making these is part of my heritage I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing your easy step by step recipes and reminding me of all those years ago when I used to go to the little bakeries and find these heavenly treats Vielen Dank Ann a k a Ingeborg
