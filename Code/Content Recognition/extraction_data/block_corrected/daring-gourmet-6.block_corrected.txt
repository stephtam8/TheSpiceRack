0.0	0.0	This pumpkin mousse recipe calls for letting it chill for at least 2 hours before serving but overnight is best for optimal flavor As such this dessert is perfect for making a day in advance and then just needs to be dished up when it s time to serve Add a sprinkling of pumpkin pie spice on top with or without another dollop of whipped cream and you re ready to roll out the dessert		
0.0	0.0	You have a few options with the sweetener according to your personal preference Use all confectioner s sugar for a lighter flavored dessert or substitute some brown sugar for a deeper flavor Additionally this is super easy to convert into Sugar Free Pumpkin Mousse simply by substituting the powdered sugar alternative of your choice I personally like Swerve Alternative Confectioner s Sugar For a brown sugar substitute I like Sukrin Alternative Brown Sugar
