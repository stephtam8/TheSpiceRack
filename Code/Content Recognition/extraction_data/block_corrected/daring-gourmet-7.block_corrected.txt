0.0	0.0	Get ready to learn how to prepare roasted Cornish hen that is super moist and flavorful with perfectly browned and crispy skin		
0.0	0.0	I ve always enjoyed Cornish game hen Growing up they were our traditional New Year s Eve dinner for many years Not only were they delicious they also catered perfectly to those egocentric developmental stages of childhood and teens where the importance of possession dominates Being in miniature form I could have an entire chicken all to myself And it s still neat to be served a mini chicken you can call your own		
0.0	0.0	One of the reasons I like Cornish hen is that it makes for such an elegant presentation It s one thing when you bring in the large roasted chicken for your dinner guests to admire and it s then carved and divided among the plates each guest with their own little pile of chicken meat and of course the dark meat lovers have to fight over who gets the two drumsticks and wings But it looks much more impressive when you can serve your dinner guests their very own beautifully golden browned hens And those dark meat lovers get both sets of drumsticks and wings to themselves Thinking of inviting your boss over to dinner to prep him for that raise request These Cornish game hens are the perfect thing to feed his ego		
0.0	0.0	Do people even still do that or have I been watching too many 60 s movies		
0.0	0.0	There are a few tips and tricks to achieving roasted Cornish game hen that is perfectly browned and crispy on the outside while super moist and flavorful on the inside Whether you re preparing a special meal for your family enjoying a romantic dinner for two celebrating a special occasion or holiday or simply feeding your egocentric needs this recipe will show you what you need to do to get the perfect results

0.0	0.0	Let s get started		
0.0	0.0	Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F		
0.0	0.0	I used fresh rosemary and thyme for these hens but you can use any herb of your choice Peel four whole cloves of garlic and cut a lemon in quarters Pat the hens dry with paper towels This is important for getting nicely browned crispy skin		
0.0	0.0	Use your index finger to carefully loosen the skin on top of the hens then slip a thin slice of butter under the skin on top of each breast		
0.0	0.0	Next slip a few fresh herb leaves under the skin		
0.0	0.0	In each cavity stuff a quarter of the lemon a clove of garlic and a sprig of fresh rosemary and thyme or herbs of choice		
0.0	0.0	Rub each hen all over with some extra virgin olive oil then sprinkle with salt and freshly ground black pepper		
0.0	0.0	Truss the hens by tying the legs and wings For a step by step visual you can Google how to truss a chicken and multiple videos will come up		
0.0	0.0	Place the hens on the rack of a roasting pan lined with aluminum foil Place the hens as far apart from each other as possible to enable the skins to get browned and crispy I added a fifth hen this time for our dinner guests Place the hens in the preheated oven and roast for 25 minutes		
0.0	0.0	In the meantime combine the chicken broth and white wine in a small bowl After the hens have roasted for 25 minutes pour the liquid over the hens reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue roasting for another 35 minutes basting every 8 10 minutes with the juices on the bottom of the pan This is important to keep the meat juicy and flavorful		
0.0	0.0	The hens are done when an instant read thermometer placed in the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F Using a meat thermometer is very helpful for getting the best results You want the chicken to be done but cooking it too long will dry out the meat		
0.0	0.0	If you want the skins browner turn off the oven to broil and roast for a couple more minutes watching closely so the skin doesn t burn Carefully remove the hens pour the juices from the cavities into the roasting pan Transfer the hens to a warmed platter remove the trussing string and tent with aluminum foil to keep warm Pour the liquid from the roasting pan into a small saucepan and boil for 5 minutes until it is a thin sauce like consistency Serve the hens whole per guest or cut them in half lengthwise placing them cavity side down on each plate drizzle with the sauce and garnish with a sprig of fresh herb and a slice of lemon Serve immediately

0.0	0.0	I usually use tongs to hold the hen and cut it with Sharp kitchen shears scissors I have a pair of kitchen aid shears and it works great I definitely Recommend cutting it after cooking and not before They are also pretty easy to split open when they re cooked so it shouldn t make too much of a mess

0.0	0.0	Hi the size width isn t so much the issue as the depth Ideally you need a roasting pan that has a rack in it so the hens can sit on the rack and their juices will drip down onto the pan below that way the skin will get nice and crispy You certainly can use a jellyroll pan but the skin on the bottom and part of the sids of the hens will be soggy

0.0	0.0	A traditional Italian take on this is to use rosemary branches branches not sprigs as the roasting rack The rosemary oil evaporates from the branches and leaves and infuses the meat Delicious It does make using pan drippings to baste a bit problematical so I just watch the temperature very carefully and never let the chicken get above 175 so it doesn t dry out Use a minestrone or pasta al pesto as the first course and accompany the chicken with a salad and a light red wine

0.0	0.0	6 After the hens have been roasting for 35 minutes reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F Pour the broth wine mixture over the hens and continue to roast for 30 minutes basting the hens with the juices at the bottom of the pan every 10 minutes or less The hens are done when an instant read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh registers 165 degrees F and the juices run clear If you prefer darker skins turn up the temperature to broil for a couple more minutes watching closely to prevent burning
