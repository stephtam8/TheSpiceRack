0.0	0.0	I ALWAYS recommend making homemade spice blends There are several good reasons for that First and foremost 1 It s fresher and MUCH more flavorful who knows how long those store bought blends have been sitting in the warehouse and then on the store shelves 2 You have full control over the quality of the ingredients you re using 3 You can tailor the ratios of the individual spices to your taste and 4 It s MUCH cheaper to make your own So as with all spice blends there is simply no good reason to ever buy pumpkin pie spice

0.0	0.0	This spice blend is easily customizable For a more intense flavor you can increase the allspice and cloves and for a softer warmer flavor you can increase the cinnamon You can play with the spice ratios and tailor it to your own tastes

0.0	0.0	Those warm and cozy spices that your and winter recipes call for such as cinnamon ginger nutmeg mace cloves and allspice when you put them all together they ve come to be known as Pumpkin Pie Spice So using this pumpkin pie spice blend is as easy as substituting it in place of any recipe that calls for any combination of those spices So if a waffle recipe calls for some cinnamon and cloves you can jazz up the flavor by using some of this pumpkin spice instead		
0.0	0.0	To add a dash of warmth and flavor to your desserts add some pumpkin spice to your muffins cakes cookies banana bread waffles pancakes rice krispie treats French toast and of course your pumpkin or sweet potato pie
