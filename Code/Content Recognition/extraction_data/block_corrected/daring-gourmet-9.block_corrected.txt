0.0	0.0	You can use prepared pie crust but for the best flavor and texture I recommend making your own and if at all possible replacing some of the butter with lard Lard yields the very best pie crust texture imaginable Be sure to use quality lard from pasture raised pigs Most of the lard you find in the stores is hydrogenated avoid it I usually render my own lard from fat that I get from a trusted local farmer see my post on How To Render Lard but for a store bought option this Leaf Lard from Fatworks is made from free ranged pasture raised pigs

0.0	0.0	There was an old gentleman I once heard avow The cow eats the grass and I eat the cow Remove your nut cutlet and your lentily dog And serve me a round off the belly of hog With this sentiment I fully agree So Sheila s mincemeat was anathema to me

0.0	0.0	Now a big problem it s hard to find suet But I got it at Orliff s so now I can do it There s nuts to crush up and apple to core And lemon to squeeze and raisins galore Brown sugar comes in and vinegar too And spices to add and not just a few		
0.0	0.0	When everything s ready throw it all in a pot Let simmer for hours but never too hot Or the sugar will burn just a slight bubble The smell by itself is worth all the trouble Then poured in tall bottles so the suet can rise And that seals it up till you re ready for pies

0.0	0.0	That s my question as well but she didn t address it I m assuming it s mixed in because she says it can be used immediately though much better if it can ripen for an extended period That really does need to be clarified for those of us who ve never made a mincemeat pie My brain is telling me to discard it because the instructions seem to be for those who keep it for an extended period and the suet s purpose is to initially flavor the mincemeat and to seal it to preserve it Personally I can t IMAGINE eating all that suet though

0.0	0.0	Mince pies are eaten at any time usually without a sauce I ve never seen them served with ice cream but I haven t been to every household in England even though I m English and have lived in England Yorkshire really for almost eighty years Our tradition is to make them on Christmas Eve and have the last one at midnight on New Year s Eve with a dram I make our mincemeat using finely chopped beef and lots of brandy It doesn t need cooking or canning as sometimes described but not in Britain and will keep forever Commercial mincemeat isn t bad and in my experience always contains suet If commercial mincemeat is acceptable why do I make it Because I make everything This year has been difficult because I ve been caring for Spouse after an accident luckily I d already made the cake back in August and had a pudding left from 2010 There are only the mince pies and stand pie to make now I even have some tomatoes left from the greenhouse very small but they ll be fine with the pork pie I wish everyone a joyous Christmas and a peaceful 2018
