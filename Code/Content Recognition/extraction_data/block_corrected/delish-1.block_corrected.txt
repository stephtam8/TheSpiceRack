0.0	0.0	By Lauren Miyashiro Nov 23 2020		
0.0	0.0	This recipe was semi inspired by the Chinese Chicken Salad at The Cheesecake Factory I fell in love with dish in eighth grade it made me feel grown up and sophisticated Twenty something years later I still find the salad delicious It s sweet savory refreshing and extremely crunchy I m a huge sucker for iceberg lettuce		
0.0	0.0	The History of Chinese Chicken Salad		
0.038461538461538464	0.0	The exact origin of Chinese Chicken Salad is unknown However legend has it that it was invented in the 1960s at Madam Wu s in Los Angeles because Cary Grant requested it Sunset magazine published a recipe in 1970 and Wolfgang Puck created his own version of it in the 80 s	Chicken Salad	
0.0	0.0	The salad itself is much more American than it is Chinese In her book The Seventh Daughter My Culinary Journey From Beijing To San Francisco chef Cecilia Chang says In China lettuce was imported and rare and salads were things that were pickled Because my recipe is based on a American chains version of a very American dish I decided to change the name to more accurately describe what it is a crunchy salad with chicken and mandarin oranges		
0.0	0.0	The Crunch Factor		
0.0	0.0	Many restaurant versions of the dish including The Cheesecake Factory use wonton strips and crispy rice noodles I sub in a block of broken up ramen the cheap dried stuff not the fresh noodles that come refrigerated Broken up the crunchy wavy noodles act as croutons The almonds can be easily swapped for cashews or roasted peanuts		
0.0	0.0	The Chicken		
0.0	0.0	Leftover rotisserie chicken works wonderfully for this recipe but if you have chicken breasts on hand follow our easy guide to poaching chicken		
0.0	0.0	Mandarin Oranges		
0.0	0.0	I m a sucker for the syrupy sweetness you get from a can of mandarin oranges But fresh mandarin oranges aka clementines will add the perfect pop of brightness to your salad
