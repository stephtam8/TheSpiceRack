0.0	0.0	One of my strongest childhood food memories is of my grandfather s pork belly stew with potatoes Dark and saucy dripping with the deep flavors of soy and five spice a layer of sticky fattiness coating my lips with each bite I was just 5 or 6 years old and already racked with anxiety when faced with his reticent nature A man of few words his seemingly austere presence always made me worry that I was doing something wrong to earn his disapproval
