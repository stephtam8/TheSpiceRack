0.0	0.0	I do not like food waste I know so many of us went bonkers this year churning out sourdough bread naming and feeding our sourdough starter babies and I truly hope you used every single last bit of your starter discards because if I find out you were throwing it all out		
0.0	0.0	Well benefit of the doubt am I right Of course you used all of that discard And if you need further proof that starter doesn t go bad if you keep it in a clean jar in the fridge just watch my 100 Christmas feast budget video where I use my very questionable starter discard in these crackers The best part These little snacky items turned out to be my partner Aaron s favorite thing that I cooked Yes I cooked for three whole days and he liked these the most They took I don t know 20 or 30 minutes of hands on time		
0.0	0.0	Which is to say simplest is so often the best So I humbly present to you these multi seed almond crackers tinged with barely detectable starter flavor This dough isn t an exact science and that s honestly what I love most about it		
0.0	0.0	Use butter or oil use whatever small seeds and grains you d like You can experiment with other flours in place of almond and cassava here I made a version with oat flour and millet seeds and I swear it was better than store bought Wheat Thins which I love to no end Add water teaspoon by teaspoon until your dough comes together it should be malleable but not sticky at all		
0.0	0.0	Depending on how you cut them this recipe yields about 20 pieces if you cut them the way that I did about 1 by 3 If you cut them down to Wheat Thins size you might end up with 50 or 60 pieces Do as you d like		
0.0	0.0	Depending on what flours you use the size and thickness of your crackers and the final moisture content of your dough your bake time will vary Nut flours with their higher fat content bake and toast much faster than say all purpose flour If you re using wheat flours in your batch your crackers might need a longer bake time between 16 and 18 minutes
