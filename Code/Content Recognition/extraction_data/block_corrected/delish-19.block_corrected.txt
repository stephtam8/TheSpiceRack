0.0	0.0	Pão de queijo an absolute sweetheart of a cheese bread from Brazil has evolved slowly through time and space to become my current favorite iteration of cheesy carbs That s why I chose to fit it into my 100 Christmas splurge budget eats menu soft slightly chewy savory bites that transform you into a cheese ball in the best way possible		
0.0	0.0	Usually made from cassava flour eggs a little okay a lot of dairy pão de queijo had humble beginnings without all the richness Born out of necessity enslaved people during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil made bread with the byproduct residue from processing cassava a staple root plant also known as yuca and manioc The starchy cassava discards also known as tapioca were then baked into breads At their inception there was no butter cream or cheese going into these bites it was purely sustenance
