0.0	0.0	A smoothie is so much more than blended fruit It s an art with all of its different elements blending perfectly together Just in case these 29 smoothies aren t enough here is our guide to making the perfect smoothie		
0.0	0.0	Pick your fruit		
0.0	0.0	We chose strawberries blackberries raspberries and bananas to be our base but any combo of fruit is great Make a tropical smoothie of pineapple mango and banana or add blueberry and peach to switch it up a bit for a summer twist Aim for about 3 cups of fruit		
0.0	0.0	Fresh or frozen fruit		
0.0	0.0	For smoothies frozen fruit is best It blends up thicker than fresh fruit and gives you a really cold smoothie to enjoy after blending If you don t have frozen fruit freeze your fresh fruit for 30 minutes before blending or add about 1 cup of ice and blend until smooth		
0.0	0.0	Add a thickener		
0.0	0.0	We use unsweetened Greek yogurt in our smoothie but peanut butter almond butter or vanilla yogurt are all great options Traditionally about 1 2 cup is ideal If you prefer thinner smoothies you can either lessen the amount of thickener or skip it all together		
0.0	0.0	Choose a liquid		
0.0	0.0	Almond milk is great for the added nutty flavor but coconut milk pairs well with a tropical smoothie and gives a richer creamier flavor Whole milk or fruit juice also work well 1 1 4 cup of liquid makes the perfect consistency for our preference If you skipped the thickener use less liquid as well		
0.0	0.0	Throw some add ins in		
0.0	0.0	Add some spinach or kale for additional nutrition or flax seeds for omega 3s Flavors like fresh mint vanilla extract cinnamon or honey will take any smoothie to the next level
