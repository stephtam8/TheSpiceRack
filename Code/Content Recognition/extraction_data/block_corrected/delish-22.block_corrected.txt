0.0	0.0	Known as Tom Kha Ghai this coconut soup is one we are always craving The creamy coconut paired with ginger and lime gives this soup it s unique and delicious flavor Lemongrass is also traditional in this soup and we d recommend adding some to this soup if you can find it Lemongrass will give it a slightly fruity flavor This Thai soup is also traditionally topped with a chili oil to give it heat it up but the creamy coconut milk mellows it out a bit so add as much or as little as you like The thighs cook right in the soup to make them extra tender and flavorful
