0.0	0.0	These easy pinwheels play tribute to our favorite French Dip sandwich Normally the roast beef would be slowly roasted to give you tender juicy beef but we make a shortcut here with deli roast beef and let them do the work for us We would never skip on the au jus though An extra savory dip made with beef broth that you ll be extra tempted to double dip in Be sure to roll these extra tight to get those super tight spirals and definitely don t skip on the au jus It s what gives it that more authentic french dip vibe
