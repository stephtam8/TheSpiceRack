0.0	0.0	What s fun about this pumpkin spice muddy munch besides EVERYTHING is you can store it in individual baggies so you and the rest of your family have a ridiculously yummy snack ready to go Because we love a good combo we use two types of cereal here the classic rice cereal squares and for added texture corn flakes For those of you with an extra bit of a sweet tooth you can swap in frosted flakes instead of the corn variety
