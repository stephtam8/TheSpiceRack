0.0	0.0	There are plenty of Jewish foods associated with Hanukkah but the only food we make for Hanukkah and nothing else is the sufganiyah This lightly fried gorgeously dusted low key sugary jelly donut serves as a reminder that life can be sweet sometimes which is exactly why we make it exclusively for the most festive of Jewish holidays You can really fill the donuts with whatever filling makes you happy as long as it s sweet This particular recipe comes from my mom who made the treat for me and my little brother once every few years or so growing up My mom is wonderful and talented but she is not a chef see she dictated ingredients to me in terms of a lot and a little etc so we had our Delish professionals take a stab at it and firm everything up to ensure perfection Check out our other Hanukkah recipes to help complete your feast
