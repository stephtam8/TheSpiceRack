0.0	0.0	Looking for a soup that is warm and hearty This beef and barley soup is just the one The silky soup is filling and full of rich savory flavor Give your beef time to get golden on all sides a step that gives the beef and soup more flavor and important not to skip The quick coat in flour also makes the beef slightly crispy on the edges and will later thicken the soup as it simmers The longer you let the soup simmer the more tender the beef will get so give it some time A little patience goes a long way with this soup but it will all be worth it in the end
