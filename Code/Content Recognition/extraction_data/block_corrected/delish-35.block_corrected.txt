0.0	0.0	English Muffins start with an overnight rise so that they are nearly ready to be baked off in the morning Once baked they get split open with a fork to reveal all of those classic nooks and crannies Perfect for the butter to melt into or to serve your Eggs Benedict on These light muffins will give your day a bright start with a slightly sourdough y taste and perfect crunch from the cornmeal crust		
0.0	0.0	Do I have to rest the dough overnight		
0.0	0.0	Not necessarily We love when doughs like our homemade bagels have an overnight rest Not only does it make it easier for timing freshly baked goods for breakfast it also gives them better flavor Letting your dough rest in the fridge overnight allows the yeast to really ferment and gives the English muffins their classic sourdough like taste Plus the longer rest creates more nooks and crannies for a lighter muffin		
0.0	0.0	If you re more pressed for time you can let your dough rest at room temperature until doubled for about 1 to 1 1 2 hours Then proceed with the recipe after the dough comes out of the fridge		
0.0	0.0	Can I freeze English Muffins		
0.0	0.0	Absolutely Once completely cooled you can freeze your muffins in an airtight baggie or container To reheat simply toast them or place them in a 350 oven for 15 minutes

0.0	0.0	Yes English muffins have a two step cooking method First they are cooked in a dry pan over low heat until a nice golden crust is formed Then they get put in the oven to let the insides finish baking It s the best way to get a crispy crust and light as air inside
