0.0	0.0	Skip the pot of hot oil and make these healthier air fryer doughnuts If you ve ever had a baked doughnut brace yourself These are SO much better Instead of tasting like a cake shaped like a doughnut each of these tastes like freshly fried classic glazed donuts thanks to the dough still being a yeasted dough They are light and airy just without the extra oil Be sure to grease your air fryer basket to help your dough not stick to the basket Straight from the air fryer they ll look a little more like bagels but everything changes once you dip them in glaze and top with rainbow sprinkles If you re a cinnamon sugar churro person you could also go that route You ll have to make these in batches since air fryer baskets are so small but they don t take long once they are in the air fryer Giving you enough time to glaze donuts during each new batch
