0.03260869565217391	0.0	Bucatini is one of our top favorite pastas It s a long thin noodle just like spaghetti but with hole through the middle It s extra thickness gives it a better bite and holds up to a rich tomato sauce Bucatini all Amatriciana is made with pancetta and adds extra saltiness and flavor to the otherwise classic tomato sauce It doesn t take hours to simmer but still comes out to be one of the best pasta sauces we ve ever had Be sure to top with lots of Pecorino and basil	Bucatini all Amatriciana
