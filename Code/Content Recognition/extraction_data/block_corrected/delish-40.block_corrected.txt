0.0	0.0	Who doesn t love a crispy edge Using a hot cast iron or any heavy oven proof skillet is really all you need to achieve it Once you re done cooking the add ins pour your eggs into the still hot skillet transfer to the oven and let it do its magic Same goes if you re starting with leftovers just get the pan nice and hot and add a little oil or butter to ensure nothing sticks		
0.0	0.0	5 Get cheesy		
0.0	0.0	Sure frittatas don t technically need cheese but how could you not Here we re using melty mozz in our base sticking to the above ratio and adding fluffy ricotta which doesn t count in the cheese ratio because it s only dolloped on top to finish Pretty irresistible
