0.0	0.0	Excellent when you have access to good tomatoes I added chopped kalamata olives and capers plus extra garlic for a bit more kick Quick easy and quite tasty My only caution is to watch the heat with the garlic or it will turn bitter I ll add the tomatoes immediately next time to avoid that possibility

0.0	0.0	Ten forks I always have a crazy amount of cherry tomatoes and basil from my garden in the late summer and I am running out of ideas for how to use them I followed this recipe exactly but in addition to the basil I added other herbs that I had in my garden rosemary parsley oregano So easy and quick No mess This turned out so great that I drank the remaining sauce from my plate I m embarrassed to admit this but it s that good

0.0	0.0	This recipe turned out wonderfully My tomatoes didn t want to burst so I helped them along with a potato masher after getting fed up with them I used about half a cup of the pasta water Used rigatoni cuz that s what I had Also added capers cuz I like them Will make again

0.0	0.0	This is definitely a summer dish the fresh basil and tomatoes from my garden made it Didn t have cherry tomatoes so I used Roma and Celebrity tomatoes cut into chunks Also halved the pasta I used rotini and added a can of drained and rinsed cannellini beans to add some protein with this change it could be a main dish for a summer lunch Final change was to cut the salt to 1 2 tsp and add 1 2 tsp Italian seasoning It also was pretty good served cold the next day but overall I preferred it warm

0.028169014084507043	0.0	This was wonderful I agree with the description of this sauce being silky The only thing I did differently was to spoon some dollops of this delicious ricotta I have on top at the end instead of parmesan Parmesan can wait this ricotta was so fresh and creamy and balanced the sauce nicely It would have been delicious with parmesan too definitely will be repeating this So fast easy and tasty	with Parmesan

0.0	0.0	This was very good My tomatoes were quite thick skinned so I cooked it a little longer than recommended but the skins in the sauce were still a little chewy Flavour wise I will add some red pepper flakes next time I did toast some pine nuts to top it off and added some white beans for added protein Might add bacon next time too

0.0	0.0	I don t usually write reviews but this sauce is so good I ll make an exception I found it while looking for something to do with all the tomatoes growing in our garden It s quick and easy to make and fine on pasta but I like it better as an all purpose spread mix in I eat it on bread mixed with tuna mixed with cottage cheese etc I make a batch and put it in a jar in the fridge then use it in various ways for a week or more So delicious it makes me smile every time

0.0	0.0	We love this recipe It captures that wonderful sweetness and slight acidic taste only from cherry tomatoes and make a fresh but rich sauce Keeping the skins on keeps so much of the cherry tomato flavor We grow fresh basil and along with our cherry tomatoes this is a go to recipe and a delightful surprise for guests when we used to have them over

0.0	0.0	I really didn t expect this to be as amazing as it was I used mixed small tomatoes just that pack you get from the grocery store and extra garlic Followed a couple of the previous reviews and added two anchovy filets Also added some chili flakes Lots of parm at the end with the basil AMAZING and so easy The sauce really thickened up so I added some pasta water This is going to be a new go to recipe for sure
