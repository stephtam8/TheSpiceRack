0.0	0.0	Turned out great Didn t have chicken stock so I used a couple bouillon cubes in boiled water Also mixed about a tsp of adobo chili paste while cooking the pasta and added minced garlic throughout the steps water pasta after adding the cream extra with chicken etc Be a bit careful about the pasta sticking together I don t usually have that problem but it might have been the size of my pan

0.0	0.0	This is easy to make and tastes good I used the recipe as a base and made some changes I did not have cream so I used evaporated skim milk I doubled the chicken but kept the pasta the same I added chopped baby spinach in the last 4 min of cooking for colour I used 3 4cup of Parmesan rather than 1 cup as I didn t want the Parmesan to be overpowering my son does not like it I needed more chicken stock at end to loosen pasta from pan I don t understand how people found this watery maybe they cooked the pasta before adding you are supposed to add it dry In future I would had hot pepper and maybe fresh basil to make the flavours even more interesting It is not an authentic Alfredo more like an Italian mac and cheese

0.0	0.0	Made as written tweaked a couple things and it turned out really well My 4 year old picky son loved it We sauteed mushrooms garlic and 1 2 an onion and added that along with precooked chicken breasts chopped at the alfredo sauce stage Added a pinch of nutmeg always the secret ingredient into sauce Used macaroni noodles as that s what we had on hand A little extra salt and pepper Great flavor very cheesy alfredo sauce and the mushroom chicken addition was delicious All it needed was a nice salad crispy bread and a glass of vino

0.0	0.0	Authentic Alfredo sauce contains 3 things a bit of hot water from the pasta cooking process butter at room temperature and grated cheese typically grana or occasionally romana That s it No garlic No chicken stock No cream No add ins I understand what this recipe provides is a common comfort food But please call it something else Call it what it is Chicken in a Parmesan cream sauce for example

0.0	0.0	Easy weeknight dinner I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it seemed a bit too runny at the end so I added about 1 4 to 1 2 c extra parmesan I agree with other reviewers that it seems like a bit too much liquid at the end although I did need the full 4 c broth for the noodles to be covered to cook so I drained a bit of the liquid didn t change the overall taste of the meal Excellent with broccoli that I steamed for about 5 min before adding I will definitely make this again

0.0	0.0	I made this receipt for a quick weeknight dinner Following other reviewers suggestion I added only enough chicken broth to just cover the pasta I had more on hand and had to add a little more periodically so it wouldn t dry out I also created a rue with the chicken broth and about 2 TBSP of flour to thicken the sauce Other notes it s not necessary to warm the cream just add it slowly and mix constantly to avoid curdling it I boiled the added broccoli before so I just had to drop it in at the end Add the cheese slowly to allow it to fully incorporate before adding more Overall a great recipe and I ll definitely be making it again

0.0	0.0	I really like this recipe Made 1 2 box pasta with 2 cups broth That was just enough liquid to cover it After the 8 minutes I had perfect al dente pasta Most of the stock had absorbed into the pasta leaving a demi glace looking reduction before adding the cream and chicken back in It looked just like the picture

0.0	0.0	This was one of my husband s favorite meals I do agree there s a little too much liquid so I just combined some of the pasta water with a little flour and added that to the sauce mixture It thickened up perfectly Add the end I added a little red pepper flakes and that was awesome

0.0	0.0	This isn t anything amazing but my kids REALLY love it Also it s the perfect meal on those nights where the kids have separate after school things going on and you re like an Uber driver that keeps getting stiffed on the fare Most recipes on Epicurious are flat out lying about how long they take 30 minutes total by backside more like 30 minutes just to get pealing done then another 45 to chop everything and finish up mise en pace THEN you can start cooking This particular recipe though it s not kidding It s super easy to make fast and there s really only a few items to clean afterward I ve made is several times and it s always a big hit

0.0	0.0	Overall this is a good dish But I will say that the pasta does require longer cook time at the final stage before Parmesan is added I cooked for 8 minutes instead of the 4 recommended This thickened the sauce up and fully cooked the penne Added broccoli and mushrooms and increased the garlic to 4 teaspoons to ensure there was good flavor Took a little over an hour to prepare from start to finish including steaming the broccoli and sautéing the mushrooms Husband loved it and asked me to add to our dinner rotation

0.0	0.0	I made this dish specifically for my 12 year old who is not an adventurous eater likes simple food and needs the calories He liked it so much that he asked me to make it again which he rarely does I thought it was flavorful and rich I liked making this dish because it requires only one pot and minimal clean up I had a jar of alfredo sauce that I used instead of the heavy cream and parmesan Other than that I followed the rest of the directions

0.0	0.0	While this was ultimately tasty I m not sure how a pound of pasta is supposed to absorb 4 cups of broth as well as another 1 5 cups of cream I had to siphon off more than two cups of liquid at the end If I had cooked it long enough for all of the broth and cream to absorb I would have ended up with pasta mush If I make this again I would use far less liquid and some kind of thickening agent to create more of a sauce consistency

0.0	0.0	This was pretty tasty however it was a little bit of a downer when my family tried it and everyone proclaimed that it tasted exactly like the store bought alfredo sauce any brand They didn t mean it as a compliment it was more like why did you bother when it just tastes the same Make sure you don t forget that it s a one skillet dish which is great unless you re like me I went into autopilot and put on a separate pot of water to boil not realizing until it was close to boiling that the pasta was supposed to cook in the chicken broth in the pan I doubled the garlic which I would recommend because I think 1 teaspoon would get drowned out by the sheer volume of the broth it s supposed to flavor

0.0	0.0	Found this recipe last minute on a weeknight and it was simple enough that my husband who doesn t cook as often was able to prepare it without asking me a million questions We had a little broccoli in the fridge so he added that for a complete meal He also halved all the ingredient amounts since we re only a family of 3 and it was more than enough We ll definitely be making this again
