0.0	0.0	Here s my basic no knead long fermented rustic bread a round loaf or boule It s an adaptation for the home kitchen of the much larger oval filone and the football shaped pugliese sold at the Sullivan Street Bakery I suggest you try this before any of the variations in Chapter Three to get the hang of it Even if you ve baked before the process is probably nothing like what your experience would lead you to expect For one thing many people who bake this bread find the dough to be unusually wet Remember that most of the water is meant to be released as steam in the covered pot and you ll be handling the dough very little anyway		
0.0	0.0	Don t feel too uptight about any of this For example I specify that the dough should rise at room temperature about 72 degrees Fahrenheit In many of the recipes I say to put the dough in a warm draft free spot same thing But if that s not what you have at the moment you ll be okay anyway Just pay attention to the visual cues At the end of the first rise the dough is properly fermented when it has developed a darkened appearance and bubbles and long thread like strands cling to the bowl when it s moved After the second briefer rise the loaf has risen sufficiently if it holds the impression of your fingertip when you poke it lightly making an indentation about 1 4 inch deep It should hold that impression If it springs back let it rise for another 15 minutes

0.9874776386404294	0.0	Preparation 1 In a medium bowl stir together the flour salt and yeast Add the water and using a wooden spoon or your hand mix until you have a wet sticky dough about 30 seconds Make sure it s really sticky to the touch if it s not mix in another tablespoon or two of water Cover the bowl with a plate tea towel or plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature about 72 degrees F out of direct sunlight until the surface is dotted with bubbles and the dough is more than doubled in size This will take a minimum of 12 hours and my preference up to 18 hours This slow rise fermentation is the key to flavor 2 When the first fermentation is complete generously dust a work surface a wooden or plastic cutting board is fine with flour Use a bowl scraper or rubber spatula to scrape the dough onto the board in one piece When you begin to pull the dough away from the bowl it will cling in long thin strands this is the developed gluten and it will be quite loose and sticky do not add more flour Use lightly floured hands or a bowl scraper or spatula to lift the edges of the dough in toward the center Nudge and tuck in the edges of the dough to make it round 3 Place a cotton or linen tea towel not terry cloth which tends to stick and may leave lint in the dough or a large cloth napkin on your work surface and generously dust the cloth with wheat bran cornmeal or flour Use your hands or a bowl scraper or wooden spatula to gently lift the dough onto the towel so it is seam side down If the dough is tacky dust the top lightly with wheat bran cornmeal or flour Fold the ends of the towel loosely over the dough to cover it and place it in a warm draft free spot to rise for 1 to 2 hours The dough is ready when it is almost doubled If you gently poke it with your finger making an indentation about 1 4 inch deep it should hold the impression If it doesn t let it rise for another 15 minutes 4 Half an hour before the end of the second rise preheat the oven to 475 degrees F with a rack in the lower third position and place a covered 4 1 2 5 1 2 quart heavy pot in the center of the rack 5 Using pot holders carefully remove the preheated pot from the oven and uncover it Unfold the tea towel lightly dust the dough with flour or bran lift up the dough either on the towel or in your hand and quickly but gently invert it into the pot seam side up Use caution the pot will be very hot Cover the pot and bake for 30 minutes 6 Remove the lid and continue baking until the bread is a deep chestnut color but not burnt 15 to 30 minutes more Use a heatproof spatula or pot holders to carefully lift the bread out of the pot and place it on a rack to cool thoroughly Don t slice or tear into it until it has cooled which usually takes at least an hour	In a

0.0	0.0	I ve been making this DELICIOUS bread for years I m wondering why you credit the recipe to Jim Lahey but you change his recipe which is perfect as is 1 ⅓ cups water is just not enough The recipe really does need the full 1 ⅝ C of water granted it can vary a BIT depending on your flour You say to let the last rise be 1 to 2 hours Jims recipe says 2 hours Your temp calls for 475F Jim 450F IMO if you credit someone else s recipe you should give it as they have written it If you want to change it just add those suggestions as your own After making the bread a few times I myself made some changes I use 1 2 cups whole wheat flour as part of the 3 cups of flour I add lots of seeds sunflower pumpkin sesame caraway flax chia etc I usually make 2 loaves at a time Sometimes I add raisins and cinnamon to one of them My bread is always great but I imagine you d have a lighter loaf making it Jim s way

0.0	0.0	I ve made this many times and it always works I am grateful for the reviewer who suggested doing the second rise in the Dutch oven in a cold stove My Dutch oven weighs a ton so with this modification I don t have to handle a super hot pot to get the dough where it needs to be Thank you

0.0	0.0	Great tasting bread and it couldn t be easier I followed Myadvice s suggestion of performing the second rise in the dutch oven then starting in a cold oven The bread didn t rise as much as I would have liked it came out looking like a ciabata but it was certainly tasty

0.0	0.0	For Slofoodie I have made this numerous times and actually used it in a bakery that I owned Here is the solution that someone else thought of and I love For the second rise put the dough on a piece of floured parchment paper Then after the second rise is done you don t have to fumble with the HOT pot and dumping the dough into it you just pick up the parchment like a sling and place it in the pot SO much easier and the bread does not become misshapen It s so much easier and your towels stay clean And one more trick you can actually do this by putting it into the pot at the beginning of the second rise on your counter along with the parchment cover and place it into a cold oven and after the time allowed for that second rise turn the oven on that way there is no danger of lifting hot pots etc I did it both ways and noticed no difference in the final product the slow rise of the temperature in the hot oven promotes another boost for the bread and then baking is done as normal Good stuff I love it

0.0	0.0	This is a lovely bread easy and delicious It looked gorgeous My wife and I scarfed down a few slices of my first try when it cooled Dipped in balsamic olive oil mix it is fabulous I did let it rise 2 wrapped in a heavily flour impregnated tea towel but it stuck and made transfer to the hot pot very tricky Despite a bit of rather brutal manhandling it turned out splendidly Getting the remaining dough off the tea towel was a chore though I wonder if putting it on Silpat or just laying the tea towel over it would work Any ideas Perhaps JTF s solution v i of leaving it in the bowl is the thing

0.0	0.0	The author of the recipe says this is revolutionary Bah This bread has been around every since someone blended flour water yeast and salt in a dutch oven It is campfire bread Here in South America it is called Pan de Cazadores Hunter s Bread baked in a dutch oven in the way dutch ovens were meant to be used hot coals underneath a layer of coals on the lid I will be preparing a batch in a couple of hours but not for a campfire just a regular oven I don t go through all the work regarding the second rise It is just as easy and effective to punch down the dough fold it over and over a few times in the mixing bowl and let it rise again and then tip the dough out into the hot baking vessel I use an ovenproof glass bowl It should be noted that come holiday time it can be made with a little less salt some honey or brown sugar some candied fruit a pinch of cinnamon drizzle the top when coolish with frosting and the neighbors get their gifts It can also be flavored with dill or with a pinch of roasted garlic powder and smoked paprika etc A friend of mine says This is so easy I feel like I m cheating

0.0	0.0	I have made this bread numerous times with great results It is unbelievably easy As suggested do not fret that the dough appears to be too wet or sticky I put a bit of flax seed on the towel for easier release of the dough into the dutch oven which by the way is more like 3 qt in my recipe I first encountered the recipe on a Laura Calder cooking show She characterized the recipe as having been in her family for years

0.0	0.0	I discovered this bread in 2008 and made it twice a week every week for several years I m out of the habit now but this bread was foolproof and became a staple of every meal for me I always made two batches at a time and gave plenty away to friends and family I would sometimes add a dash of olive oil for some extra richness but other tasty variations include dehydrated onion and poppyseed dried fruit chocolate chips garlic cloves and my personal favorite green garlic stuffed olives I found that this bread continues to work well with up to 2 3 wheat flour though I usually stick with the white Seeing the recipe here I m excited to start making it again

0.0	0.0	No I cannot believe that there is not one review on this delicious bread I make this exact recipe every single day for my husband and me and also friends and family I always have a couple of batches of the dough in the fridge at all times because I can t handle the thought of not having this scrumptious bread in my house I can almost make this bread with my eyes closed and have yet to bake a loaf that hasn t been fantastic I get such a kick out of making this particular recipe and find it such a therapeutic experience Try it you will not be disappointed I promise and you will get so many compliments
