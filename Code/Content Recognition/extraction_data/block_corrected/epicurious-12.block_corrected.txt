0.0	0.0	Store bought yogurt may be convenient but it can t compare to the mild creaminess of homemade The good news is that making yogurt is incredibly easy as long as you keep your tools clean and don t jiggle the mixture while it s setting it s almost foolproof Plus it s a fun science project for experimenters both young and old		
0.0	0.0	Homemade yogurt requires very little special equipment You can invest in a yogurt maker but there are many potential incubators you might already own such as a thermos Alternatively you might use a covered container set in a conventional oven preferably with the light on a microwave a cooler place jars of hot water inside to help maintain a warm environment or a slow cooker preheat the slow cooker but turn it off to incubate Another option is to simply swaddle the covered container with a heating pad blanket or towel		
0.0	0.0	And while yogurt requires at least five hours to incubate there s only about 30 minutes of active time You can even make the yogurt before going to bed and let it incubate overnight		
0.0	0.0	For your first few batches we recommend treating yourself to whole milk because it produces a naturally thick final product However yogurt can be made with skim or low fat milk it just will probably be a bit thinner than store bought varieties which often contain thickeners

0.0	0.0	Yogurt needs to incubate for at least 5 hours but it can safely incubate for much longer even overnight If you re using a yogurt maker with a timer and you set it for a shorter incubation 5 hours for example it s fine to let it sit there for several more hours The same is true for a thermos or other incubation method just keep in mind that the longer the incubation period the thicker and more tart the final yogurt The whey that drains from the yogurt is full of vitamins and minerals and can be added to smoothies and lassis used as a cooking liquid or made into a simple drink with a bit of sugar or salt As an alternative way to thicken yogurt whisk in 3 or 4 tablespoons nonfat powdered dry milk when you add the starter This recipe may be doubled or tripled increase the amount of starter and milk proportionately

0.0	0.0	I have made yogurt at home a few times and it came out great It was tart and creamy but this weekend I made the yogurt the same way as before but the milk was cooler about 80f when I added the cultured yogurt I let it cure overnight and the next day I transferred it to plastic containers and put it in the refrigerator Today I went to eat some and poured off the whey and it was very viscous The curd was very firm and sweet not the tart like before I am wondering if this is safe to consume

0.0	0.0	Well this HAS been an adventure It s all about the process My aunt introduced me to Bulgarian yogurt this fall and yogurt has not been the same for me since I decided to try my hand at making Bulgarian yogurt following your recipe with some modifications Using store bought non fat Bulgarian yogurt as my live culture and non fat milk After three failed attempts two with the addition of a yogurt maker incubator I decided to take a closer look at my ingredients and process Turns out my milk was ultrapasturized Although I incubated for 12 hours my yogurt was soupy and 50 whey Not very appetizing Next I opt for 2 milk not ultrapasturized and use unflavored 2 Greek yogurt Drum roll here after 8 hours my yogurt looked beautiful and creamy I refrigerated uncovered in the fridge for three hours Success has not every tasted so sweet Having been successful with 2 milk twice next I opted for 1 milk using 3 Tbsp of my most recent yogurt as my active culture Incubated for ten hours after reading lots of post suggesting lower fat yogurts require more incubation Continued with uncovered refrigeration for three hours and Success achieved AGAIN Yeah My next adventure will entail attempting skim milk and wish me luck This really has been fun

0.0	0.0	Wow Greeks have made yogurt before electricity No incubators necessary I make this recipe by the gallon Bring to boil and reduce heat to 110 120 Use 3 TBL to 1 4 cup starter yogurt into a portion of the cooled milk to thin it then add to the cooled milk At this point I cover and place in a warm area or in the microwave with the surface light on over night The longer it incubates the stronger the flavor Want thicker Greek yogurt Fold a cheese cloth 4 6 layers and hang it a few hours Want healthy alternative to cream cheese Hang it longer My dog likes the whey tgat drips out No need to buy anything to make yogurt

0.0	0.0	This is a good recipe except for the fact that the fat content in the starter you use IS important For the creamiest end result use plain Greek yogurt as a starter Also save some of what you made for a starter for your next batch You don t need a thermos When you have added the starter take the pot off the stove and wrap it in a blanket and set it where it won t be toppled over I put it in the bedroom and let it sit overnight Great homemade yogurt

0.0	0.0	To A Cook from Planet Earth The process you describe is exactly how I learned to make yogurt from my Lebanese grandmother who had never even heard of a food thermometer It was the pinky test all the way I still do it this way For those of you who want Greek style straining is easy To the cook with the mess in the cheesecloth if you let the yogurt drain longer the part in contact with the cheese cloth will become very thick and then you can almost turn out the product in a clump I start with two quarts of fat free milk and generally end up with about 1 quart of yogurt once it is strained Yum
