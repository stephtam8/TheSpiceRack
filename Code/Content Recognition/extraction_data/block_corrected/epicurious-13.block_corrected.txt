0.0	0.0	I doubled the recipe right from the get go and changed only one thing and added another Making this bread for a person that has dental problems I used walnut flour in place of crushed in the bread and and made a gentle crumble topping out of the walnut flour melted butter and dark brown sugar Results were outstanding and I have been requested to deliver one of these once a week I consider that to be a overwhelming success

0.0	0.0	Hands down the best banana bread I ve ever made The only change I made was to substitute 2 3 of the flour with whole wheat to give it some protein and it still came out moist and not too heavy Next time I may reduce the sugar by a bit since with 4 bananas the bread is sweeter than I would normally like

0.0	0.0	This recipe is amazing It s the first time I have made banana bread muffins over and over since I found this recipe a few months ago First and I think important I made sure to measure the very ripe bananas to 13 ounce since banana sizes vary so much I made a couple small changes so I wouldn t feel as guilty eating so many I used 1 cup super fine blanched almond flour and 2 3 cup all purpose flour I cut the dark brown sugar down to 1 2 cup I added 3 4 cup Lilys dark chocolate baking chips Stevia sweetened I used a regular size muffin tin and baked for 30 minutes It made 19 muffins Other than that I did everything else this recipe says to do My mom said it s the moistest banana bread she has ever had And coming from my mom the baker that is a true compliment Enjoy

0.0	0.0	I made this recipe as written I was very happy with it I used very ripe bananas and was not overly generous with the leavening ingredients It rose beautifully was not overly cakey and was very well balanced I did not add nuts this time as I was testing the bread by itself Now that I know it works as written I can experiment with the flavors

0.0	0.0	I made this while at a friends house who was fresh out of baking powder nary a bread pan in sight no electric beater and the only yogurt no sour cream she had mixed up granola in I still made it work using a little bit of cornbread mix because it had powder added about 1 tbs of cream cheese a good amt of maple syrup then I just adjusted the flour baking soda butter and cornbread mix until I was satisfied with how the consistency turned out in the microwave on a small scale I used 2 mini muffin pans and topped the muffins with one package of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal They were incredibly tasty moist and perfectly sweet I was very pleased with the outcome Between my friends bf my friend and myself we scarfed all 32 muffins before the end of the day I m fixing to make this at home now good and proper this time around

0.0	0.0	Truly the lightest and most flavorful banana bread recipe I made the exact recipe without nuts the first time The second time I added the zest of an orange and mini semi sweet chocolate chips in place of the nuts It took exactly 60 minutes in the oven I rotated after 30 minutes and placed an aluminum tent at 45 minutes to prevent it from getting too dark I also used dark brown sugar I am now eating my second piece with a little cream cheese Sooooo good

0.0	0.0	Loved this recipe very well balanced with lots of banana flavor I substituted buttermilk for sour cream as that s what I had on hand Appreciate a previous poster mentioning she made this substitution and recipe still turned out great Toasting walnuts is a must Think I might add some dark choc chunks when I make it again Only warning is that clean up is not quick you use 3 mixing bowls plus mixer and sifter in addition to all the standard stuff
