0.0	0.0	Make ahead marinated lentils give heft protein and a rich earthy flavor to this pantry only pasta dinner The secret is to use some in the sauce and save some to sprinkle over the top for texture and flavor contrast The small amount of bacon in the sauce is optional but highly recommended

0.0	0.0	This was delicious We have a 3 5 and 7 year old and they all loved it too We used Chianti red wine and I added extra garlic I used my Ninja blender to purée all of the sauce but kept some lentils to add on top Wonder if how this could be made quicker in the instant pot maybe It s a keeper

0.0	0.0	Fantastic Made just as outlined We loved it Great leftovers as well Next time we make I will use very few of the lentils as a topping at the end I think they do their best work a bit softer and in the sauce itself I m more of a meat eater but would take as an equal option to a meat based bolognese any day That said that little bit of Pancetta goes a long way

0.0	0.0	Like many I had lentils sitting in my pantry Thanks for this out of the box idea for using them The smoked paprika in the Big Batch Lentils kicked up the smoky meatness of the dish even though I did use the bacon I actually made half of the lentils and then half of the bolognese and think the recipe for the bolognese makes more servings than noted in the recipe We had two hearty servings from the half batch with at least two more left for lunch tomorrow Agree with the comment that there is no need to hold back lentils for topping With good control of an immersion blender the texture is perfect Also loved that you included my favorite tip of using a pair of kitchen shears on the WP toms

0.0	0.0	I also thought it was very good but 2 tbsp of harissa were too spicy for my wife Also saving some lentils to put on top seemed unnecessary since there were still plenty of unpureed lentils at the end anyway I ll make it again for sure

0.0	0.0	Early in the day I made up a bag of black lentils in the pantry I d been sitting on for years waiting for a public health emergency apparently and refrigerated I left out the bacon used tomato paste no harissa dumped in half a bottle of a disgusting cabernet probably double the recommended amount but was very happy to see it go the tomatoes and wondered if I was missing something because there was nothing else to really do Pureed most of it in a stand up blender and returning it to the pot realized this was a much larger amount of sauce than we usually mix with a pound of pasta Saved half of it for later Mixed in pasta and topped with Parmesan Even my pickiest kid loved it It was a raw day and this was so rich and satisfying And I have a night off later this week So great I d give it five forks if I could

0.0	0.0	This was good Cooking the lentils makes this kind of a lengthy process but very hands off or if they re already cooked no problem I doubled the bacon and it could have taken even more and would some red pepper flakes next time since our harissa wasn t that spicy A nice twist on red sauce

0.0	0.0	I used 1 pound of penne rigate pasta and that was not enough for the volume of sauce A blender was used in the absence of an immersion blender While well received it wasn t a 4 star		
0.0	0.0	Absolutely love this recipe Not a big meat eater hence Lentil Bolognese sounded appealing So satisfying and comforting Used GlutenFree Tagliatelle pasta and it s perfection The butter really adds a slight salty punch I used shallots instead and it fit my tastebuds triple dosed on Harissa Tomato paste for extra oomph to the organic diced tomatoes Would make this over and over and over again since shelter in place Can t wait to drop some off for friends Thank you

0.0	0.0	This is absolutely delicious I don t have an immersion blender but after tasting what the first half tasted like coming out of the stand up blender I had to blend the rest As best I could You can make this vegan with vegan butter and it doesn t need the bacon It makes a lot
