0.0	0.0	I made this yesterday and it was a hit with the family I followed other s advice and poured the sauce over the stuffed shells in a casserole dish It did allow more time to prep the shells without burning the sauce My only modification was to add a little cooked Italian sausage Definitely a keeper and will make again

0.0	0.0	The response in my family is Oooohhhh stuffed shells or Can you please make this more often This is a keeper Yes more complicated than throwing some pasta sauce together but worth it for the responses Looks beautiful on the table too A vegetarian dish that makes meat lovers happy because it s so creamy and filling Faster than lasagna

0.0	0.0	Yes this is tasty But next time I m stuffing the shells putting them in a baking dish covering with sauce and mozzarella on top The only flaw with the recipe is letting the sauce cook down while you stuff the shells Unless you have the dexterity and speed of someone who does it all the time by the time you are finished stuffing the shells the sauce is like tomato leather on the bottom of the pan Had to add a ton of water to rehydrate it

0.0	0.0	Made as is except added a shallot and baked in the oven for 25 minutes at 350 as per suggestions by posters It was very tasty and looked pretty too Had it with salad and garlic bread Next time I think I will add mozzarella and maybe reduce the ricotta a tad

0.0	0.0	I have to state up front I was looking for a neutral recipe for cheese stuffed shells so I could use up some Italian sausage I accidentally thawed out So this was never going to be a vegetarian recipe for me Except for the sausage which I browned and added to the marinara sauce I kept true to the recipe Or rather I thought I did until I reread the recipe and realized I left out the wine The final dish was still superb Richer than I would have thought Pretty sure it would have been even better if I had remembered the wine Two shells and a slice of bread filled me up Like others I baked it I ll be making this again With or without the sausage Yum

0.0	0.0	Good idea finishing these on the stove I like how quickly this came together but the filling was watery probably because I didn t let enough of the liquid evaporate Next time I make them I will be a little more patient on that step I might also drain the ricotta before adding it to the filling That will add to the prep time but it will make it easier to stuff the shells All in all these were tasty enough and I will make them again		
0.0	0.0	I recommend adding a little lemon zest to the filling Following the recipe I was able to stuff 20 shells very full I do not find this recipe to be that quick though I heated them in the oven instead of the stove at 400 degrees for maybe 20 minutes with some foil on top

0.0	0.0	I made this tonight and it was delicious with the following minor adjustments I added a small shallot finely chopped to the mushrooms and sautéed them together and I added one finely chopped roasted red bell pepper to the ricotta mixture I also nestled the shells in a baking dish and baked covered with foil at 375 F for 30 minutes For those who thought that it was just okay it probably had to do with the marinara sauce that you used I used Mezzetta

0.0	0.0	I d give this a 3 5 if possible It is delicious I followed the instructions with two changes 1 subbed riced broccoli in place of the spinach someone in our home has an allergy and 2 rather than heat the stuffed shells in the pan I transferred them to a casserole covered it with sauce and baked it for about 25 minutes at 350F I used homemade ricotta which mixed well with the cooked veggies The recipe indicates it makes 4 servings but we had plenty for perhaps 8 generous portions One quibble the recipe suggest that it comes together in 35 active minutes but though I m an experienced cook it took MUCH longer maybe an hour to chop the veggies cook them mix up the stuffing mixture stuff the shells etc All the steps were easy but I d not classify this as an easy week night meal Maybe if you prepped the ricotta veggie mixture cooked the shells and even prepped the sauce the day before it would go together in 35 minutes Or maybe I m inept Or slow At any rate it is delicious and I d be pleased to serve it to guests as well as make it a home favorite

0.0	0.0	I made this last night and it was lovely except I really wonder which shells we are talking about I weighed 18 De Cecco Conchiglioni Rigate shells the largest I can find in Switzerland and they came to about 3 1 2 oz I cooked about half a pound 40 shells and had enough stuffing for 33 of them I usually stuff these shells with mozzarella other stuff but found the ricotta to be lighter and much less stringy and chewy I ll adapt my other recipes too

0.0	0.0	This was great I did make my own sauce though However adding the sauce to the butter sauteed garlic added a very nice dynamic in flavor Next time I will definitely reduce the pepper not pepper flakes by at least half maybe more If you don t use baby spinach make sure to chop regular spinach prior to putting in the pan so it s mixes easier and is less clumpy in the ricotta
