0.0	0.0	I have been an enormous fan of the true gin martini for over 30 years Gin is a very unique drink in that riots and fist fights can start over which is the best I have enjoyed Boodles Tanqueray and 10 Bombay all three Gordon s and Beef eater to name a few Vermouth I always go for Noilly Pratt And lightly at that Whatever Gin you use just make sure it is very high proof At least 94 47 proof Go for Navy strength if you can get it 50 proof A martini is a serious no children allowed cocktail I stuff my own olives unless I m having a Gibson I use three One with Roquefort cheese one with a salted anchovy and with a Spanish cured anchovy Tip If you ream out the tip of plastic cajun injector syringe you can put room temp Roquefort or Blue in it and inject the olive It saves enormous time and mess A paper clip opened up serves as a perfect gaff to pull anchovies into your olives Obviously you need to ditch the pimento Enjoy I certainly do

0.0	0.0	Yes as with many recipes one can adjust depending upon one s taste But the key with such a simple drink is the gin and vermouth Noilly Prat is my fave but I also like Dolin also French My favorite gin used to be Junipero but now I prefer Plymouth English gin Though the price just jumped dramatically so I ve been using Bombay Sapphire which I like Olives or a lemon peel twist are the classic garnishes NOT cocktail onions The latter turns the drink into a Gibson

0.0	0.0	Just to clarify a dry martini DOES refer to the amount of vermouth in the actual drink as opposed to Manhattans in which case it refers to the type of vermouth used As for this recipe perfectly proportioned for a classic martini cocktail For an extra dry martini swirl and dump vermouth to infuse taste without overpowering the gin For an exceptional martini try Magellan and for a slightly unusual one try Hendrick s

0.0	0.0	A classic dry martini ALWAYS includes vermouth I agree that Noilly Prat is the only way to go and the proportions should range between 5 1 to 8 1 Thus by my lights this is a good and correct recipe Your mileage may vary A chilled glass is very important I keep mine in the freezer The gin should not be in the freezer since the point of chilling it with the ice is to impart a bit of water into the drink otherwise it will be too hot As for the gin try Junipero by Anchor Distillery truly a revelation It will spoil you for nearly any other gin Finally I always stir back forth up and down the shaker for about 30 seconds It makes for a crystal clear martini preventing the ice shards and cloudiness that shaking introduces God now I m going to have to go make one

0.0	0.0	For those of you anti vermouth people the dry in dry martini refers to dry vermouth as opposed to sweet vermouth not to lack of vermouth I like a wicked cold glass of good gin as much as anyone but that s not a martini If you ve never had a gin martini with a ratio of 4 1 gin to very good vermouth like the Noilly Prat you should give it a try You might be surprised

0.0	0.0	The perfect cocktail in my estimation Fie on the masses who think that a martini can be made with vodka or shudder fruit flavored spirits and liqueurs Bombay Sapphire just enough vermouth and two olives make this my favorite occasional vice While I agree with the reviewer who eschews pimientos a large green olive stuffed with good blue cheese can be a revelation in this drink

0.0	0.0	Yes this is my favorite The Noilly Prat vermouth makes the drink it s expensive but in my opinion gives the best results Beefeater gin is good but not my favorite I use Booth s good and not expensive I d suggest avoiding perfume y gins e g Tanqueray they tend to be overpowering
