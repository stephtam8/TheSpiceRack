0.0	0.0	After seeing the cinnamon roll from Paris s Circus Bakery pop up everywhere on Instagram we developed this recipe as an homage Hey it was cheaper than a plane ticket Circus Bakery s roll is made with sourdough but our cardamom scented version is more briochelike of course they re both streaked with a sweet buttery cinnamon filling It takes some practice to master the distinctive twisted shape try it out a few times with a twisted up towel or piece of parchment paper to get a feel for it And if your knot isn t perfect don t worry The buns will be delicious no matter what

0.0	0.0	This was a really yummy recipe that I m definitely using again Some tips I would add If you don t have a stand mixer melt the butter and allow to cool and add to the wet ingredients before the flour Make sure you knead sufficiently I ground up my own cardamom from the pods and the flavor was very vibrant and you could really smell and taste it I also added clove to the cinnamon mixture because I though it would go well the the cardamom and the cinnamon and it worked really well ๑ ๑

0.0	0.0	Lovely and easier to pull together than expected This is the family s new favorite cinnamon roll but I agree with others that it could benefit from some tweaking to bring out a bit more depth in the dough A bit more cardamom for sure and perhaps starting with sourdough like it says is used in the original I also like the suggestion of making smaller rolls although we found it easy enough to half these and sharing one makes it feel like you re not so quite off the rails on your diet

0.0	0.0	This is a great recipe As stated elsewhere the cardamom is very subtle and I would increase next time Also I found the 8 rolls a bit large I will be making them again but dividing the dough along the width so 12 1 inch strips I have also seen savoury versions of this recipe and plan to try those also

0.0	0.0	Absolutely outstanding I think they re my most favorite cinnamon bun ever They re fun to make the dough is beautiful to work with they come out incredibly soft and tender and they re not too sweet It was a challenge the first time but then you get the hang of making the twist and roll The cardamom is subtle Add a little more to the filling if you want a stronger cardamom flavor Watch carefully and don t overtake I take them out just as they become golden in couple places Perfect lockdown activity

0.0	0.0	I ve made these twice in one week now because they were such a hot commodity the first time around They were gone in less than a day The second time I made them my parents were swarming around the stove like sharks as they were baking They re a serious project for someone that barely goes into the kitchen but definitely worth it My dad called them special and said they brought him back to his childhood High praise from the man that calls any dessert I make sticky buns in reference to my mediocre baking skills But I followed the recipe exactly and really studied the step by step pics referenced before delving in and they came out so great The smell of the dough before they even go into the oven is heavenly I guess it s the cardamom which I d never used before but am glad to have become acquainted with These are perfect just the right amount of sweet not cloying at all which is why they go so fast And they photograph beautifully if you want to make faraway relatives and friends jealous

0.0	0.0	Absolutely phenomenal recipe Time consuming but so are all yeasted buns like this I followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out perfectly It definitely took a bit to get the twisting technique down but by the 8th one they looked pretty great Delicious too Definitely go for the double round of brown sugar glaze My family now wants me to quit my job and sell these at the foot of our driveway to the neighborhood

0.0	0.0	These were very tasty Made these with sourdough starter per SusanKent question they turned out excellent I used 150g of 100 hydration starter swapped out for 75g milk and 75g flour After the initial mixing and kneading I did two series of pretty aggressive stretch and folds at 30min intervals and then let it bulk rise for 5 hours in a 68 degree kitchen I did not punch down before putting in the fridge I cooled them for an hour after initial roll and again for 30 min after spreading filling and rolling out I also let them do a final proof of about 2 hours They were tender and even though I questioned the need for glaze the cinnamon and cardamom flavors popped more after 2 coats Thanks very much

0.0	0.0	On point I disagree with some of the other reviews that said these buns are not soft or too crisp This was the most tender pastry dough I ve ever made and even though I didn t knot them tight enough they were so soft and delicious A huge hit not too difficult and will definitely make again I did have add a tad of sugar to my milk yeast mix to get the visible layer of foam

0.0	0.0	OMG While labor and time intensive these rolls were absolutely lovely Not too sweet with a moderate amount of cinnamon Reheated them after a couple of days of being plastic wrapped in the refrigerator misted with water topped with plastic warmed 50 power for 30 seconds They turned out picture perfect		
0.0	0.0	Perfect I would rate myself as a moderately skilled baker These turned out beautifully Not syrupy sweet like a popularly known chain s When you glaze them it adds another subtle layer of flavor and keeps the texture soft rather than crisp while still hot out of the oven I followed the recipe I did leave the dough in the refrigerator overnight Perfect just perfect P S I did weigh my ingredients grams rather than use volume measurement

0.0	0.0	Award winning recipe I made and entered them in the OC Fair and they won 1st place They are so delicious and beautiful I ve made them about 10 times now and every time the lucky recipients rave about them They have more surface area than a traditional cinnamon roll so they don t have that super soft inside texture If you really like that then you will be somewhat disappointed in these They are not quick or easy They take about 2 hours day 1 with about an hour of active time I have to let my mixer rest for 15 minutes in between the two beating sessions I put the mixer on a placemat that has a rubbery underside to keep the mixer from moving around the counter too much Total time on day 2 is about 3 hours of which about an hour is active I ve found them easier to work with when I refrigerated the rolled out dough for the full 60 minutes After I form the buns I let them rise for 1 hour They never did double but 1 hour in a house that s 75 works well

0.0	0.0	I just finished making these buns and I am very disappointed For all the time I put into making them it was not worth it They came out looking exactly like the picture I find them rather tasteless I made them to sell at my Farmers Market Based on the reviews I made them expecting Nirvana The sticky buns I made a few weeks ago from Cooks Illustrated has a fabulous dough When making this dough it looked very strange And beating it with my dough hook was rocking my kitchen aid mixer And I hv a 6 quart one and it s an old one They don t make them as good any more And the instructions I felt were not great I took my hand mixer to mix the filling so I could spread it better I won t make it again Sorry
