0.0	0.0	Loved this recipe thank you Made a double batch my first time around and filled all 12 4oz mason jars to hand out to friends and neighbors I added zest to the sugar only first while I juiced all the fruit Then beat eggs thoroughly before adding to sugar mixture Added juice then before heating Butter went in last while over heat I had no eggs pieces in the curd once complete and enjoy the zest in the there so chose not to strain My husband and I enjoyed a couple spoonfuls once chilled giving us our fix until we figure out what to put this in on Love love love Will be sharing and making many more batches

0.0	0.0	So easy and delicious to make I decided to follow one of the reviewers from Yonkers by creaming the butter eggs and sugar together before heating in the pan I then added the lemon juice and zest to the pan heating it on medium low for approximately 6 minutes whisking continuously throughout the cooking time It actually started bubbling and getting very creamy before the 6 minutes were up So I lowered the heat until it was done and then put the lemon curd in a small bowl inside a larger bowl filled with ice i decided to use the lemon curd to top a small plain cheesecake I had bought at a store and then top that with fresh raspberries It was an easy and delicious recipe that wowed my host and hostess

0.0	0.0	This is my go to curd recipe I have done it in a few different ways for Cake Pie fillings I do a few teaks to it for a more fluffy less dense texture cream the butter sugar and egg mixture first before heating with my hand mixer However sometimes I like it dense I also do not strain mine I like the zest it in Thank you Epicurious
