0.0	0.0	This was delicious I pan fried the crimini mushrooms for about 10 minutes like another reviewer said and then toss them in the thyme garlic red pepper flakes and put them in the oven for about 10 minutes just before the rest of the rice was ready This will form part of our weekend rotation recipes

0.0	0.0	This recipe is fantastic Admittedly I am a bit intimidated to make risotto so this recipe was perfect for me We choose it to accompany veal cutlets and a Barolo wine Hands down the risotto was the star of the dinner I agree with others that you ll need to roast the mushrooms for twice as long to obtain desired end result so allow extra time on that front Will make this again for sure

0.0	0.0	I m shocked at some of these comments My husband and I thought this was one of the best Risottos we ve ever had Now granted I had to cook the mushrooms twice as long as called for in order to get them crispy and they were ultimately divine Really a nice touch and so much better than the mushroom Risottos I ve had in restaurants I didn t have any dry Vermouth so I mixed a white wine with brandy and it was great Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly Next time I ll do it for company

0.0	0.0	This is an okay risotto If you have made risotto before it won t be anything special If you have eaten risotto in a good restaurant before it won t be that good The mushrooms were a nice touch on top but they were not crispy Surprisingly they came out rubbery I followed the instructions exactly except when it says Stir in rice season with pepper and 1 2 tsp salt I made it 1 4 tsp salt based on everyone else s comment that this dish was too salty I agree with one of the other reviewers who said that being an oven risotto didn t seem to make it take any less time It was still a meal I couldn t have made on a weeknight Again I thought this was an okay dish but because I was looking for a good dish that I could make quickly with less effort I probably won t be making this again

0.0	0.0	Loved this recipe I served it last night and we all had seconds Next time I m going to double the recipe as one of my favorite leftovers is risotto patties Like other reviewers the mushrooms didn t crisp up but it didn t make a difference I ll definitely make this again It tasted just as good as the stir for 30 minutes on the stovetop method

0.0	0.0	Found this through the best of 2019 list and it did not disappoint We used a Spanish Muscat Gewürz huh and a homemade stock with some anise in it the bone broth from Melissa Clark s Dinner in an Instant that was maybe a bit too strong for the dish but still delightfully flavourful a bit of a five spice vibe We also missed our timer in the oven so over baked the rice by about 6 mins but only very slightly more than ideal still a bit of chew and didn t need any simmering after the oven Found the mushrooms let go a lot of water so drained them at the halfway point and used that for the remaining broth to add at the end Would probably drain them at least twice next time as they were not quite crispy even turning up to 375 for a few mins extra Draining did not detract from the flavour especially using the water as broth at the end Will definitely make again and maybe add in some asparagus or try some other variations listed below as this was definitely a less labour intensive risotto than others we ve made Great dinner party dish and easily made vegetarian

0.0	0.0	Easy and good I used mushroom broth fortified with some Better Than Bouillon I should have cut the salt down but forgot so it s a little too salty but otherwise followed the recipe basically as written except that a couple of steps took a little more time I left the mushrooms in the oven for 35 or 40 minutes to get them to crisp and I gave the final stirring on the stove about 5 minutes before I felt it was ready

0.0	0.0	This was wonderful and I will be making it again very soon I didn t find it was necessarily a big time saver though I used extra chicken stock instead of water and used a low sodium one I stirred the mushrooms in and just saved a few for the top and would 100 do that next time There were only two of us and the leftover were fantastic

0.0	0.0	Delicious The only thing I d change is setting the oven hotter since the mushrooms didn t crisp up and the rice was soupy so I had to bake it at 375 for 15 minutes more Topped with some Indian pickle for some extra tang

0.0	0.0	This is DELICIOUS Followed the recipe to a t At the end finished w a very small amount of truffle oil My mushrooms were pretty crispy but I chopped them a bit smaller than the pic and roasted on convection 325 on the bottom rack Curious if the others put the pan on the bottom rack who didn t get crispy The mushrooms will shrink by half FYI Don t skip the lemon zest It takes it to next level Enjoy
