0.0	0.0	Epi associate editor Emily Johnson liked her family cookie recipe but thought it could be even better So she started making it with butter instead of margarine increased the salt and used chopped chocolate instead of chips This new version has since become her new favorite cookie recipe and she thinks her family and yours will agree

0.0	0.0	I was looking for another go to recipe for oatmeal chocolate chips and I think I found it I reduced the brown sugar by 1 2 cup but otherwise followed the recipe I made them smaller than the 1 4 cup recommended but that s just personal preference

0.0	0.0	This is my go to cookie recipe that I have been making almost weekly for my chocolate chip cookie fanatic family We love the chewiness of using large flake oats I also add in about 1 2 to 3 4 cup chopped pecans or walnuts that have been toasted for 10 minutes in the oven for extra flavour I will make a batch one day and then bake the next day These freeze well too

0.0	0.0	I would recommend these cookies if you want something a little different than regular chocolate chip cookies The texture is a little different than that of regular chocolate chip cookies because of the oatmeal but the flavor is really good However the batch makes a lot Even though it makes a large amount of batter you can refrigerate the left over dough to save them for later I also have made these more than once so definitely bake them

0.0	0.0	This recipe was just okay I see that it has a lot of great reviews but I found it lacking in flavor and I even added cinnamon Maybe it would be better with raisins and nuts rather than chocolate chips Otherwise it baked into nicely rounded cookies that flattened out as they baked no problems with excess spreading to the person who had that problem you may need to add more time to the beating butter sugar step Mine took closer to 6 minutes to become light fluffy

0.0	0.0	Fantastic recipe Chilling the dough overnight helps develop the flavors You get a much richer more flavorful cookie However I don t keep salted butter only unsalted and grass fed Made this with unsalted butter and not sure it d be edible if I d used salted and I adore salt Also recommend adding in 1C of coarsely chopped pecans
