0.0	0.0	If one pasta dish exemplifies the complexity of pan sauce precision it s cacio e pepe literally cheese and pepper The minimalist recipe calls for only a few ingredients and doesn t even include garlic But the techniques outlined here elevate the dish to something magnificent The creamy twirl of noodles is like a stripped down mac and cheese only more elegant and easier to make No wonder it s on the menus of America s most stylish Italian restaurants It s a simple standard by which cooks are measured yet no two chefs agree on how to do it right We sorted through the variations and found it works best with a mix of Grana Padano velvety and Pecorino sharp cheeses and freshly cracked black pepper you should taste the heat

0.0	0.0	If you make this dish as the Romans do there is no need for the butter ugh nor the Grana Padano or Parmesan It s just made with spaghetti Pecorino cheese pepper and some of the pasta water That s what made this dish famous Any and all variations are fine but you should think of giving them a different name

0.0	0.0	Amazing and SO easy I didn t use anything fancy and followed the instructions I only had grated Parmesan on hand This is seriously one of the best pastas I ve made Wait until the pasta is done to make the sauce because it cooks extremely quickly I m trying really hard not finish the whole 6 oz of pasta because I m supposed to save some for my husband

0.0	0.0	My spouse called this the best pasta we ve ever made restaurant worthy So I guess it goes on the rotation It s easy to make as long as you have everything at the ready because it goes fast I used grana padano and gorgonzola because that s what I had on hand The secret is to make it exactly as it s written or else the cheese is liable to clump which is not restaurant worthy

0.0	0.0	I ve tried other techniques for Cacio e Pepe but this pan sauce method is easy and fantastic It s worth splurging on good imported Italian pasta and Grana Padano for this Just do not overlook the pasta it finishes in the sauce and soaks up the pasta liquid and becomes creamy not saucy The cheese pasta and pepper are a brilliant triad If you use quality ingredients and follow the instructions you will be rewarded Pretty easy to impress with this once you get it down

0.0	0.0	I ve made this using various techniques This technique works well I used a Vitamix to grate the cheese finely so it melts into the sauce easier It seems like such an easy recipe but some methods result in gloppy cheese masses instead of a nice sauce Dinner s ready in the time it takes to cook angel hair Serve with french bread and a side salad
