0.0	0.0	Editor s note The recipe and introductory text below are excerpted from Paula Wolfert s book Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco Wolfert also shared some helpful cooking tips exclusively with Epicurious which we ve added at the bottom of the page		
0.0	0.0	Preserved lemons sold loose in the souks are one of the indispensable ingredients of Moroccan cooking used in fragrant lamb and vegetable tagines recipes for chicken with lemons and olives and salads Their unique pickled taste and special silken texture cannot be duplicated with fresh lemon or lime juice despite what some food writers have said In Morocco they are made with a mixture of fragrant skinned doqq and tart boussera lemons but I have had excellent luck with American lemons from Florida and California		
0.0	0.0	Moroccan Jews have a slightly different procedure for pickling which involves the use of olive oil but this recipe which includes optional herbs in the manner of Safi will produce a true Moroccan preserved lemon taste		
0.0	0.0	The important thing in preserving lemons is to be certain they are completely covered with salted lemon juice With my recipe you can use the lemon juice over and over again As a matter of fact I keep a jar of used pickling juice in the kitchen and when I make Bloody Marys or salad dressings and have half a lemon left over I toss it into the jar and let it marinate with the rest Use wooden utensils to remove the lemons as needed		
0.0	0.0	Sometimes you will see a sort of lacy white substance clinging to preserved lemons in their jar it is perfectly harmless but should be rinsed off for aesthetic reasons just before the lemons are used Preserved lemons are rinsed in any case to rid them of their salty taste Cook with both pulps and rinds if desired

0.0	0.0	I ve made preserved lemons a few times but never with an Epicurious recipe There are several things I notice here that I d avoid for perfect lemons 1 Don t soak the lemons in water to soften the rind It will soften naturally in the salt and soaking them before hand will only reduce the flavour 2 Don t add other spices such as cinnamon Any additional spice other than salt can encourage bacteria growth 3 I ve had my current batch in the refrigerator for over a year and a half I use it whenever I make a curry a Moroccan tagine or when I want an additional flavour in a Bloody Mary I also make limes like this use in the same way I hesitate to say not to worry about discolouration but I don t and my batches all get a dark brown salty brine between the lemons over time This hasn t killed anyone yet and I doubt it ever will Salt is an absolutely perfect preservative and preserved lemons limes exist for months if not years in places where there s no refrigeration Just make sure you really pack those lemons in tightly allow the least amount of space possible when you first pack them And always check them during their initial curing stage to both add more fresh sliced salted lemons or just to add more salt to what s already in the jar Get the smallest lemons you can find Every recipe for preserved lemons will recommend Meyer but really they re so difficult to find that you ll be just fine with the smallest lemons available

0.0	0.0	of all the preserved lemon recipes out there this is my favorite i had tried preserving lemons a while back but didn t sterilize the jar and mould grew this time i used a large dill pickle jar because i had 12 14 lemons following the sterilization instructions i also added whole cloves and red pepper flakes to the spice mixture and the result was wonderful i ve been using the lemons for 2 months now and haven t added additional lemon juice or salt as i ve removed the preserved lemons from the brine the brine is unctuous but easy to rinse off if you re making a chicken slide the four sections of the preserved lemon skin under the breasts and thighs along with some fresh thyme leaves bake at 475 for 50 60 minutes for a 4 5 lb bird the results are amazing for an added treat roast the bird over a single layer of quartered small potatoes that have been mixed with olive oil salt pepper and some of the preserved lemon flesh
