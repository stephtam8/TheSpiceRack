0.0	0.0	I don t get how some reviewers found this recipe soupy mine wasn t at all I didn t find the recipe bland either but that being said I did add some ingredients to the sauce In addition to the 2 tsp salt and 1 2 tsp pepper I added 1 1 2 tsp of dijon mustard 3 4 tsp nutmeg 1 tsp of garlic paste and a pinch of cayenne I used a mix of mature cheddar and mild cheddar The sauce by itself had a very strong cheese taste don t let this worry you because after mixing and cooking it in the macaroni the taste dampened a bit I also cut up 4 large basil leaves and added them to the mixture right before baking As for the topping I diced about 200g of lean bacon and added it to the mixture My family is very fussy about mac and cheese and they loved it I do have to mention though if you are a beginner cook like me this recipe might take you double the amount of time so be prepared

0.0	0.0	The bones of the recipe helped me make my family s favorite Mac Cheese The consistency of the sauce and idea of browning the crumb crust prior to baking was perfect I did make these adjustments 1 I substituted 1 4 tsp of Garlic Powder for the fresh cloves because I was concerned that fresh garlic would burn in the panko crust 2 In both the crust and sauce I used a 1 4 c gruyere and 1 4 c parm mix instead of 1 2 c parm 3 I only used 1 tsp of dry mustard in the sauce 4 I also added about 1 4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg to the sauce After trying at least 20 recipes this is now my go to

0.0	0.0	This recipe is hands down awesome While mac and cheese is one of those dishes that EVERYONE has the best recipe for this one is absolutely one of those that can easily be a starting point for even more creamy cheesy shenanigans My only criticism is that the garlic in the topping can be a little over powering my family LOVES garlic and so I instinctually probably used too much Don t get me wrong it s delicious but I certainly won t have any vampires near me or my kitchen for the next few days Despite that bravo Epi

0.0	0.0	This is my go to recipe for Mac and Cheese now and I ve made this multiple times in the last few years I do make a couple changes at times though usually depending on my mood I made this again last night 5 1 2019 and used rotini instead of elbow mac so there s more surface area for the cheese and added in a large helping of mozzarella to give it that stringy gooey look everyone loves I also added in a little more heavy cream just to see what would happen magic happened haha In any case I freaking LOVE this recipe

0.0	0.0	I really really love mac n cheese and this is the best recipe I have come across to satisfy my love of this dish I did cut the mustard powder in half and used a small amount of garlic powder with my panko crumbs and as one reviewer suggested I added a small amount of nutmeg to my cheese sauce I sprinkled the panko over the mac n cheese before placing it in a preheated oven covering the pasta but I didn t use all of the crumbs My guess is the fact that I used an aged sharp cheddar and a quality Locatelli Pecorino Romano helped to make the dish so flavorful I took my time and followed each step in the recipe and was rewarded for my efforts I didn t find the cleanup a big deal so don t let the comments about using a lot of pans discourage you from making this awesome recipe BTW I love to cook by no means am I a great cook or one that typically makes complicated dishes

0.0	0.0	Pretty good Even reheated The only changes I made was 4 3 4 cups of 2 milk cuz that s all I had and I used only a cup of plain bread crumbs sans the garlic and baked for an extra 5 minutes BTW I used cheap mild cheddar cheese Very comforting Be sure to cook white sauce for three minute at a low and steady boil This will be elimate the too floury taste

0.0	0.0	This is my favorite macaroni and cheese recipe When done right it is heaven When done wrong it is indeed meh or worse Do agree with the caveats others have mentioned have found that 1 cup of panko sparingly applied as a topping works best One thin sliver of minced garlic mixed in the panko is also my preference Too much garlic can EASILY overpower the breadcrumbs and thus the entire dish Since the cheese is the star of the dish have also found using a high quality brand of extra sharp cheddar is worth every penny All in all a stellar recipe and even though I agree it doesn t need to gussied up once in a while I do like to add in already cooked shrimp for the final bake Yum

0.0	0.0	If you made this and it has no flavor you need to look at the ingredients you are using to make it Does the cheddar you used have a good flavour or is it bland supermarket dreck Same goes for the parmesan and the cream if the ingredients you put in are bland the result is going to be dull and lifeless A good strong cheddar will cut the mustard and balance the other flavours over the palate it s not rocket science

0.0	0.0	This recipe was extremely easy You will have a multiple cheese covered pans by the end however it s well worth the mess The only adaptation to this recipe I would make is the amount of mustard powder The 1 1 2 tablespoons was a bit too much I love the flavor but it was a bit overpowering it managed to mask the pound of cheesy goodness I would change this to just 1 tablespoon or perhaps taste a bit as you add another excuse to eat the incredible melted delight

0.0	0.0	This was very easy and warranted rave reviews from my family I would absolutely make this again the Panko Crumbs were terrific and added crunch a bit too much crushed in the topping I would use less next time I used 6 cups of cheese but in a mixture of 2 cups cheddar 2 cups American White 2 cups Provolone shredded Scrumptous Thanks for the recipe

0.0	0.0	I think this is a great recipe I used almond milk because that s all I had and it still turned out very nice Followed all other instructions except that my kids don t want the baked kind so I just did the cheese sauce part Needs a little more pasta when you don t bake it and I think a little less salt but that is a personal preference thing If you don t love salty then adjust it and season to taste at the end

0.0	0.0	Made this and will make it again I was looking for something to use up all the leftovers from a big cheese platter I ended up doubling the pasta and the pan size but kept the sauce the same proportions The cheeses I used were extra old cheddar Bluda blue gouda from PEI brie and parmesan we only had about 3 cups worth and it was fine The panko and garlic crumbs were an outstanding addition

0.0	0.0	I made this for dinner with a group of friends and it was great I didn t think the panko was too much because I love my mac and cheese to have a really thick layer of crumbs on it but it could be too much if that s not your thing A couple adjustments I made I used Colby Jack for half of the cheese because that s what I had and put Lawry s seasoning in the sauce and it turned out really tasty Also I would use a little less garlic in the bread crumbs next time It was good but a bit too much Definitely making this again
