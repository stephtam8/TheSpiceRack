0.0	0.0	These little salmon bites are something I ve made time and time again over the years and this method of roasting them at a high temperature ensures you get a little charring on the outside yet perfectly cooked salmon on the inside Leftovers also make a great addition to your lunchbox the next day

0.0	0.0	I loved this for the speed ease and freshness Big pay off for such little effort I had the same experience as Nancy in CA Also added a splash of rose water to reg harissa I don t think you d get the char as directed before the fish is overdone but I loaded up chunks on parchment and slid onto preheated cast iron sheet pan at 550 Yes this is pressing boundaries for parchment but it worked After about 6 7 mins I switched it to the infrared broiler short time still no paper catching fire haha to get that char and did achieve some nice char underneath from contact with hot cast iron too Came out so juicy inside this way charred on the outside and just great as directed in tortillas with all recommended fresh add ons including some crushed Maldon s and a squeeze of lime

0.0	0.0	I was surprised how well the high heat cooking technique worked and I have adopted it more generally to get always from always doing straight salmon filets I have personally found a coating of mayo gochujang and a bit of soy sauce is very tasty Kewpie or standard mayo both work fine The key thing is you want something that can really coat and protect the salmon from the convection inferno while it cooks As another Minneapolitan here in the comments observed it does indeed work nicely with tofu I personally like to freeze thaw and then tear up the tofu however more surface area for more coating and thus more flavor and the freeze thaw gives it a bit more chew I like it you might not Note that frozen tofu tends to turn slightly beige totally non aesthetic for a lot of preparations but coated or in a darker sauce it s unnoticeable

0.0	0.0	Delicious and great taste profile Idid not get the crunch but did not cook as long was afraid of overcooking it so dependent on the thickness of the filet Will definitely try it again great healthy dinner

0.0	0.0	This is so darn good I especially love having the salmon bite leftovers They make for a healthy and satisfying snack the next day much better than reaching for something processed I try to make this once a week I know I will get a great hot meal out of this recipe and a day or two of healthy snacks after

0.0	0.0	I made so many changes that not sure it s legit to leave a review First of all my grocery store surprisingly didn t have rose harissa or even rose water so I just went with sriracha caraway as a sub for that ingredient and used hot paprika Ground all the dry ingredients including garlic what are garlic granules anyway and then mixed in the yogurt and lime juice Made a lovely marinade which tells you something about how flexible this recipe is But why does call it a marinade when you re supposed to cook it right away So I did let the fish sit in the yogurt et al for an hour or so then cooked over high heat with a little oil in a non stick pan Made it much easier to assess the doneness than the oven Took about 6 7 minutes Served with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli Leftovers might be nice in a pita but my DH agreed that tortillas would just be weird

0.0	0.0	Like others noted 10 min was too long The biggest issue was finding a thick enough piece That may have lead to the dryness and fast bake Other than that the flavor was excellent Yogurt added a cooling touch to the spice We used the leftovers the following day in fish tacos It tasted even better

0.0	0.0	I made it as directed At 10 minutes the skin was burnt and the fish was well done and dry There was very little flavor But I had to try it because I love yogurt marinades If you make this I would suggest you check it at the 6 7 min mark I would also suggest you serve it with a sauce Also there is no reason to use a nice finishing salt in this dish Just use plain old kosher salt or sea salt Finishing salts go just on just before you serve something
