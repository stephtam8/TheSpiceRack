0.0	0.0	This is so a keeper I understand that there s no egg white but with the issues we have with contamination I can live with the compromise I swear I have never had a problem with this recipe The only problem is cutting in the whipped cream it can take a strong arm I ve made it with bittersweet and semisweet chocolate and both have been dreamy What really has blown me away is the possibility of adding flavorings alcohol fruit whatever goes with chocolate and what doesn t The point is follow the recipe and don t be intimidated it works Friends will love it

0.0	0.0	This is delish I didn t alter the ingredients at all but I did change the methodology For reviewers who complained about using too many dishes I made the custard and cooked it to 150 degrees Instead of melting the chocolate I put chopped chocolate directly into the custard no straining required Once the custard cooled I folded it into the whipped cream and then chilled as directed An easy make ahead dessert Perfectly smooth and silky

0.0	0.0	Don t be afraid to make this recipe If you have or can create 2 double boilers this recipe is almost full proof The technique is like a sabignon except the cream needs to be hot Melt the chocolate as you prefer remembering that you can have small chunks of chocolate left after the active heating and they will continue to melt with residual heat Ok for the custard heat the cream in one double boiler I ve never had any problems with over heating You probably want to do this as you mix egg yolks salt and sugar Now set the egg mixture on the second double boiler and whisk in hot cream At this point I do use a temperature probe This method should remove the major problems for this mousse The only other thing I can think to note is don t over mix the whipped cream into the chocolate base It needs all the air to keep it light NOW for the easy part try to leave some for someone else This is delicious

0.0	0.0	I have made this many times It is not the easiest recipe I have messed up several times too Every step has to be perfectly timed and the correct temperature if too hot or too cool it can go wrong It also uses a LOT of dishes and bowls That being said it s worth the trouble 160 F is too high for the custard it always ends up scrambled if you try to reach that temp I heat to 140 which is when it coats the back of the spoon and lower heat is better but it takes longer I have salvaged custard that was looking a bit scrambled by using a stick blender at high speed I have also salvaged the chocolate that looked a bit grainy using the same technique Make sure you have everything ready with the whipping cream and the egg whites I also always whip the egg whites and use 3 4 of them folded in with the whipped cream to lighten the texture because I find the custard and chocolate mixture cools fast Straining the custard is an absolute must to get a perfectly creamy texture I have added different flavours cinnamon and or cayenne pepper to the mousse I have also added pure peppermint essential oil not peppermint extract to very lightly sweetened whipped cream served on top and garnished with a fresh mint sprig Wonderful Christmas time dessert The real peppermint oil adds an amazing authentic cool minty flavour Pure essential oil is very strong you only need a few drops I personally find it s better when you use a more bitter chocolate vs a milk chocolate I usually use 70 cocoa chocolate for 3 4 and add 1 4 milk chocolate It s delicious and everyone loves it

0.004651162790697674	0.0	Good though some trouble shooting items 1 To prevent egg scrambling I would recommend against cooking mixture to 160 unless maybe you re pregnant and need to be careful about undercooked eggs Instead I would cook it stirring constantly until it coats the back of a spoon I would do this over low heat only not medium low Never let your custard mixture come to simmer Straining it is a good idea 2 I would not cook the chocolate in the microwave for 3 minutes That s a recipe for burnt seized chocolate If you re going to use a microwave I d do 20 seconds at a time giving things a quick stir in between Once it s almost completely melted i e mostly melted with a few chunks still in there I d take it out and add the still hot egg mixture it ll do the job of melting things the rest of the way 3 I used 60 cacao chocolate and while the mousse was good I think it was not quite sweet enough I would consider adding another tbsp of sugar Or perhaps substituting honey for sugar since it tastes sweeter I don t tend to like overly sweet desserts but this one could use a tiny bit more sweetness	minutes

0.006493506493506494	0.0	Fantastic recipe first time making this I used 60 bittersweet Ghirardelli baking bar Scalded heavy cream with vanilla then allowed it to cool to 110 degrees I added half of this to the beaten egg yolks sugar mixture Then added back to other half of heavy cream on stove top Kept the heat on simmer and cooked just before boiling constantly stiring entire time Added pieces of chocolate bar to custard mixed until all choclate was melted and blended in I placed this is the fridge to cool over night however it was too hard in the morning so I placed in microwave for 30 seconds This brought it back to about room temperature Folded in remaining cream stiff peaks I thought it was too rich so I beat an additional cup of heavy cream to stiff peaks and added to mousse This made it very light and fluffy with an excellent rich taste	before

0.0	0.0	Sooo good I m a baking student and for our final we have to make any type of mousse I messed up my recipe we made in class so I wanted to find an easier recipe to make I did what the other reviewers said and whipped the egg whites and added those in with the cream as well But for an extra stabilizer I added cream of tartar After setting in the fridge over night it s so fluffy and soft I used 2 chocolate bars that I got from world market that were a mix of milk chocolate and dark chocolate so it wouldn t be too rich It s so good I might try to use this recipe to make a lavender mousse to pair with it I definitely recommend this recipe It tastes like a chocolate milkshake haha

0.0	0.0	I feel ambivalent about the texture I recommend chilling the custard and THEN mixing in the whipped cream because adding it to the warmed mixture led to a loss of volume I think WeeSin this may help your consistency problem Otherwise good chocolate sugar salt balance in the flavor The salt is key Don t waste your egg whites people Make a scramble or freeze them for when you want to make chiffon cake Let s not be wasteful here yeesh
