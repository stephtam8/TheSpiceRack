0.0	0.0	Its a bit odd to make pasta without boiling and I chose the wrong noodle next time will use a lighter less dense pasta Also I think a different fish than tuna or fresh tuna would do well Overall we liked the heartiness the tactile feel and the aroma

0.0	0.0	A great recipe I had everything on hand except the roasted red bell peppers so I used some sundried tomato pesto maybe about 3 tbsp for depth of flavor I also used rigatoni I would probably use a smaller tube pasta next time just because I found it challenging to stir the mixture without making a mess But I loved the browned pasta I think next time I ll add olives either kalamata or green Spanish olives for some extra zing
