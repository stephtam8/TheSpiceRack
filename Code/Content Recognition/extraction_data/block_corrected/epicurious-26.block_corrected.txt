0.0	0.0	This gratin is decidedly autumnal inspired by a recipe from one of my favorite food writers Richard Olney Olney s chicken gratin calls for making a savory custard but here you ll combine brown butter and heavy cream with aromatics for a flavorful and easy sauce instead It s still a luxurious dish The breadcrumbs for the topping get toasted separately so they stay crisp and the chicken ideally seasoned a day in advance so the salt has time to work its way into the meat and vegetables can get nicely browned and crisp too		
0.0	0.0	I love that this gratin can reinvent itself based on what s available at the market or in my fridge In the spring you might make it with asparagus and young onions in summer with tomato wedges swapping in olive oil for the cream I recommend serving this fall version with lemon wedges for squeezing over to cut the richness of the dish A brightly dressed arugula salad would also do the trick

0.0	0.0	This was an easy to make dinner Per other reviews I halved the salt which worked out well I didn t have enough cream on hand so I added evaporated milk and then added a bit more since my family loves gravy The nice part about the evaporated is that the dish still feels rich and creamy without being overly rich Lemon slices on the table are also crucial to brighten the dish to taste

0.0	0.0	As others have stated there is way too much salt I cut it back to less that half and it was still overly salty Otherwise this was an excellent chicken dish and the herbed brown butter sauce was superb I brought the sauce to the simmer point added the herbs covered moved off the heat and let it steep for 2 hours then reheated before pouring over the chicken I also added baby bella mushrooms and cippolini onions because I had to use them up to the potato mix and they were truly delicious Bon Appetit

0.0	0.0	I don t like the recipe as written so I m giving it 2 forks but I ll make it again with a couple of changes First as it was I couldn t bring myself to use a whopping 4 tsp of salt to season the chicken one simply doesn t salt any kind of meat that heavily So I cut it down to 2 and the dish was still too salty Cut the quantity of salt way down Second I would cut off the root ends of the shallots and I would slice them lengthwise as stated more evenly rather than the hodgepodge of sizes created by slicing shallots in assorted sizes in half

0.0	0.0	Everyone loved this dish I used only bone in chicken thighs in my preparation My first inclination while I was preparing it was that it might be too salty It was quite a bit saltier than I prefer but not worse than the way most restaurants serve proteins or gratins of any sort My wife and son said that it was salty but not too much so I added sautéed cremini mushrooms to my dish and it was an excellent addition imho I prefer less salt but that wasn t necessarily the consensus Everyone told me that it s a keeper so highest rating from me

0.0	0.0	Delicious dish I will definitely be making this again After reading some previous reviews I cut back significantly on the salt but then found I needed to add more when it was time to eat The cream sauce was decadent the chicken skin perfectly crisp and potatoes were cooked just right I highly recommend trying this

0.0	0.0	An amazing recipe the best kind of comfort food I d suggest halving the salt on the chicken I also made some big country croutons out of the extra bread 1x1 which I baked into the dish But that meant that I needed a bit more sauce I ll definitely make this again with more sauce I served over a bed of lemon herb Israeli couscous which was perfect particularly because I did squeeze lemon over top to brighten at the end A wonderful dish I also prepped and put together ahead of time popped in fridge and then baked 1hr before my guests came which worked out well I wonder if that helped with flavorfulness I m not sure how why someone would find this dish lacking in flavor Mine was succulent and bursting with flavor
