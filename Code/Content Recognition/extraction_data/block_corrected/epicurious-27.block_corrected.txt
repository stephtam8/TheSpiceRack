0.0	0.0	Claire Saffitz named these her forever brownies because it took so much work to get them right that she s vowed to never develop another brownie recipe again Selfishly we hope that conviction doesn t hold One of the hardest aspects to nail was the chewy and fudgy texture which she eventually achieved by chilling the baked brownies in the fridge for at least an hour Sprinkle flaky salt on top of the batter prior to baking if you re a salty dessert person

0.0	0.0	Distracting recipe with unnecessary paragraph openers e g Add the dry ingredients My oven is perfect calibrated and 30 mins was not enough to produce the same degree of doneness in the center pieces of an 8 inch square pan as the edge pieces which were delightfully chewy IF and that s a big if I make it again I will bake it a little but longer and perhaps use a 1 4 sheet pan for shorter more evenly baked brownies increasing the recipe by 1 2 Tip if using milk chocolate chips these will need to be chopped into quarters lest there be unmelted pieces floating around

0.0	0.0	Wow I get to be first reviewer Here goes Brownies are a regular event for me The inclusion of malt powder was enough to tempt me to stray from my usual recipe Results Ooey gooey Indeed some of the fudgiest brownies I have ever had They did not want to come cleanly out of the pan Tons stuck to the foil I think I should have waited longer with them in the fridge or maybe given them an extra 5 minutes in the oven for a total of 35 The malt powder didn t end up adding any obvious flavor to these brownies Go with these for the fudgy texture
