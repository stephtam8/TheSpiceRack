0.0	0.0	This recipe is a keeper Doubled it for a crowd and used two whole cut up chickens Used a spice mix of cumin coriander turmeric cinnamon allspice smoked paprika Used dried cherries diced prunes along with chickpeas white beans And also used chicken stock instead of water for some more richness All of the tweaks worked well though cooking time was longer than 25 mins to get everything cooked properly The dish was hearty rich and a little exotic almost Moroccan fused with Jamaican Everyone loved it and the rice bean mixture with the spices was a hit Will most definitely use again

0.0	0.0	This recipe was easy and delicious I used 1 2 tsp of turmeric curry and coriander and the teaspoon of cumin I increased rice to 2 3 cup and added a little extra water I used 4 large chicken thighs with the skin removed Definitely going to make it again

0.0	0.0	I made this recipe with about a 1 lb of cubed chicken breast and mejdool dates as the dried fruit Also added some ground cumin garam masala and a clove of garlic as other reviewers suggested This recipes calls for way too much turmeric would suggest using no more than 1 2 tsp I used 1 tsp and it was too much and stained everything I may also up the rice to 3 4 or 1 cup next time I could barely see it in this dish

0.0	0.0	Delicious This was part of the Cooking Through It series and as someone who doesn t cook much for oneself I am cooking for one and I am a food writer so I often eat out togo this was a perfect supper I ve got some leftovers the flavors were great I used turmeric cinnamon and chickpeas I also added in the chili flakes I did not have dried fruit but it didn t matter The drumsticks were divine and I was just so excited that it worked that I spent probably 20 minutes just staring at my food before devouring Absolutely delicious

0.0	0.0	This dish has become a weekly staple because of the versatility of the ingredients I like to use a bit of paprika on the chicken along with the salt and pepper while adding little bit of powdered mustard after adding the rice and water Grilled vegetables pair nicely with the rice and chicken I usually go for sweet potatoes peppers and onions My main goal is to make the dish as colourful as possible

0.0	0.0	Like several other reviews I used thighs I followed as written using turmeric and cinnamon raisins black beans I can see using other fruits and spices will change it up but I bet it will still be delicious Like the idea of dried cranberries and apples from another reviewer A definite keeper recipe

0.0	0.0	Like other reviewers I used chicken thighs since I had them in my freezer For spices I used one Tbsp of cinnamon 1 2 tsp of paprika and 1 4 tsp each of curry powder and ground coriander Used one can of Navy beans drained and well rinsed Dried fruit was raisins and cranberries mine was closer to 3 4 cup total Also increased white rice to one cup and substituted two cups of chicken stock for the water Lastly let the rice and chicken cook in the sauce for approximately 15 minutes before adding the beans for the last ten minutes of cooking time It came out delicious Thinking about changing up the next time I cook this by using dried apples and cranberries omitting the beans and upping the veggies perhaps sweet potato to pair with the apples Definitely a keeper

0.0	0.0	I made some changes and I air fried the chicken I added some ginger with the onion and I omitted curry but used fennel seeds and zaffaron The dried fruits are a must I added also some dried apricots I omitted beans as I believe the dish did not needed My husband enjoyed it very much certainly I ll make it again

0.0	0.0	This is amazing with a couple of tweaks I use all the spices each at 1 4 tsp I add 1 5 tsp Better than Boullion Chicken to the hot water but I think chicken stock would work just fine I use cranberries I don t cook the chicken in the pot I roast the chicken in the oven using another Epicurious recipe Crispy Chicken with Potatoes its basically a quick roast chicken I rub the chicken with the same spices in this dish and season well with salt and pepper in a roasting pan Then start making the rice and beans with this recipe starting at the 3rd paragraph heating a little oil in a pot and add onion When the rice is set to simmer for 20 25 minutes I put the chicken in the oven They are usually done at the same time I use thighs instead of drummies Serve the succulent roast thighs in the bed of rice and chickpeas sprinkled with fresh herbs Delish

0.0	0.0	Obsessed with how the rice and beans turned out We used 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp cinnamon as I didn t have anything else in the house with white rice raisins and chickpeas delicious The drumsticks ended up kind of rubbery will try it with chicken thighs next time or skip the chicken altogether

0.0	0.0	Love the flavor but my chicken thighs were rubbery I m not sure why no one else had this problem given the recipe states Nestle chicken back into skillet and bring liquid to a boil which means the chicken boiled for a bit too I should have known better and waited to nestle the chicken after the rice was mostly cooked

0.0	0.0	The basic recipe is delicious My husband loved the rice I should have used 1 cup of rice to 2 cups chicken broth I did not use fruit this time nor cilantro I modified the recipe because I did not have the beans so I used frozen peas But after eating it I feel that it leaves itself open to adding other ingredients which makes this fun to work with Next time I will try peas and carrots mushrooms I need to try it with another cut of chicken as my husband does not like drumsticks or thighs But the basic recipe is very tasty And simple easy to make Many of the other reviews have some good suggestions worth reading
