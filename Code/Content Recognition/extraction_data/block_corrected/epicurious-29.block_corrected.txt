0.0	0.0	This is apparently a simplified modern version of what was a more complex traditional dinner offering of stuffed eggplant Joe The original robust version involved preparing a stuffing of ground beef that had been lightly browned and sauteed with the holy trinity in Philippine cooking known as the ricado of well sauteed garlic onion and tomatoes The meat stuffing was then piled onto the charbroiled peeled and flattened eggplant with stem on to maintain the eggplant s body integrity then heavily swathed in a seasoned beaten eggs dipping You then fried the egg coated eggplant stuffed side up in just a few tablespoons of oil till crisp browned on the bottom and thereafter deftly flipped the eggplant to brown the stuffed side held together by the egg coating and your spatula Sumptuously delicious served with fish sauce over freshly cooked rice P S The same ingredients and cooking method produces an even more exhilarating dish when done to a charbroiled peeled hollowed out whole green pepper Again served with fish sauce over warm rice of course

0.013888888888888888	0.0	So simple customizable Instead of fish sauce or hot sauce I served with roasted green beans tossed in kimchi the kimchi provided a great flavor blast while the roasted beans provided a nice crunch contrast to the soft eggplant Make sure to flatten the eggplant pretty well before frying I only gently pushed it down while still delicious it ended up being slightly more like french toasted eggplant than an eggplant omelet	fish
