0.0	0.0	I ve been making this cheesecake for 30 years Over time I ve cut the amount of sugar in the crust and in the batter I ve found it s best to make it a day or two before you serve It needs a lot of time to cool before it s refrigerated Top with pomegranate seeds in winter strawberries in summer When I make any other cheesecake my children complain Why mess with perfection

0.0	0.0	This is my family recipe that we have been making for 40 years You can make the recipe EXACTLY as it is written and it will turn out perfectly You do not need a water bath To avoid cracking let it cool on the counter for an hour before refrigerating This will also help to not get condensation on the plastic wrap The absolute most important thing about this recipe is that the cream cheese and eggs must be at room temp It will not work otherwise

0.0	0.0	This recipe is amazing I bake with water bath method Using a 6 spring pan inside an 7 cake pan to protect from water seeping through and a tall 10 x15 x3 tray of water With this recipe you can make 2 cakes at once Great to bring to party and keep one for yourself Careful not to over bake this cake I found a lower temperature for a longer time brings out the creaminess of it I d check the giggle factor when time is near done I ve been using Digestive Cookies for crust It s so good A lot of work in lining the crust around the wall and bottom I ve since skipped the wall and just make a thick crust on the bottom alone Much quicker and need less butter to keep it up and also a better distribution of crust to cheesecake ratio in each bite Do respect the time to chill Just leave with breathable cover on like a strainer Let chill at room temperature for about 6 hrs I ve several times had condensation watery surface because I put into refrigerator too early Lastly cross reference with other cheesecake recipes This recipe is amazing but there s a lot of techniques you can learn from elsewhere e g a water bath don t over mix lower temperature etc

0.0	0.0	Whoops Sorry The best cheesecake recipe Ever was from Lindy s in New York 2 1 2 pounds of cream cheese and a homemade shortbread crust not that nasty grainy dry graham cracker stuff This recipe is published all over the web look it up And no toppings please totally unnecessary People who truly love cheesecake really should try this but it s not for the faint of heart
