0.0	0.0	Easy recipe rose beautifully worked great for my first attempt at cinnamon rolls Unfortunately as others have mentioned the sweetness is overpowering to the point that I didn t really want more than half of one roll And I m not usually one to complain about that If I make again I would use the dough but search for a different filling and or glaze

0.0	0.0	Delicious and quite easy I was worried the dough wasn t rising enough but after the second rise they were perfect I agree that they are pretty sweet I d recommend cutting the sugar filling down a bit you could probably use half

0.0	0.0	Delicious pecans gave this roll a little bit of a crosssover into a sticky bun another favorite of mine They did not come out perfect being my first time making cinnamon rolls but fortunately the good ingredients held the flavor up I also froze over half of the batch and even though the dough was slow to rise after thawing the taste was still great when cooked later

0.0	0.0	This is one of the easiest cinnamon roll recipes I ve used and I ve tried many I love that it all mixes up in the stand mixture Like others I start with the paddle attachment to combine the dry ingredients with the eggs and the warmed milk and butter then I switch to the dough hook right a way for kneading It is a very sticky dough but avoid the urge to add more flour I don t do any extra kneading I just take it right from the mixer and scrape it right into the bowl for the first rise I also cut back on the sugar since I like a less sweet finished product and the filling and glaze are plenty sweet for me I like to put the dough together the night before and then let the roles rise a bit before baking however I ve also just started them early on a weekend morning and had them ready for brunch This will be my go to roll for Thanksgiving morning

0.0	0.0	I ve used this recipe a few times now and only this recipe so I can say with great certainty Wow KAITLIN C FROM CT however points out that the recipe is missing the KNEADING instructions as originally printed in Bon Appetit I used the dough hook to mix the ingredients and when my mixer protested I did it by hand Once all was incorporated I kneaded the dough Here are the kneading instructions as originally printed in 2008 Turn dough out onto lightly floured work surface Knead until smooth and elastic adding more flour if sticky about 8 minutes Form into ball Lightly oil large bowl with nonstick spray Transfer dough to bowl turning to coat Cover bowl with plastic wrap then kitchen towel Let dough rise in warm draft free area until doubled in volume about 2 hours

0.0	0.0	I would have given these 4 stars based on how well they turned out but I only gave three because I thought there were some pretty big flaws with the recipe First of all I wish the recipe included weights With 3 5 cups of flour 4 5 oz cup it was much more like a cake batter than a bread dough I had to add 1 2 3 4 cup extra just to make it come together into a very sticky dough Additionally these were the strangest directions for mixing a yeast dough I ve ever seen it called for mixing only with the paddle attachment of a stand mixer and no kneading at all I tried to follow the instructions but ultimately switched to the kneading with the dough hook until I had a smooth elastic dough because my heavy duty mixer was jumping all over the counter trying to mix at medium speed with the paddle attachment Based on some prior reviews that these were too sweet I referenced Alton Brown s cinnamon roll recipe for the filling I used 2 tbsp of melted butter brushed over the dough and reduced the sugar only 1 cup I followed the instructions for shaping the rolls refrigerating overnight and baking the next morning They turned out beautifully and were incredibly delicious I d use the recipe again but would just mix and knead like any other yeast dough instead of trying to follow the instructions in this recipe

0.0	0.0	These were wonderful rolls and fairly easy to make Two small things to note they are VERY sweet One might consider using a tad more cinnamon and a tad less brown sugar to cut the sweetness if you re not a fan of super sweet Additionally I used a recipe for cream cheese icing instead which I thought worked very well
