0.0	0.0	I read the helpful reviews and tweaked as follows sautéed 3 cloves garlic one small onion and mushrooms in olive oil Set aside In same pan cooked the chickpeas in oil with 1 tsp paprika 1 tsp turmeric 1 tsp chili powder and 1 2 tsp cayenne Combined all ingredients added a beaten egg in a food processor and pulsed Followed the rest of the instructions for freezing and baking We ate them as a side dish which worked well

0.0	0.0	Hmm These are flavorful but just absolute mush Impossible to eat on a bun They need some kind of binder maybe egg although that would probably change the flavor quite a bit

0.0	0.0	Super easy I can see what other reviewers are saying they were a little crumbly but I ve found that to be typical for a veggie burger I just chopped up the mushrooms pretty small but I think for next time I ll put them in a food processor

0.008771929824561403	0.0	Like other reviewer s I pulsed my mushrooms in a food processor The end result was tasty but a little mushy I think I will leave them in the oven longer next time although I did get the nice crunchy exterior The family opted to add this to the regular rotation which I like because I can freeze them and make a quick and healthy weeknight meal but the enthusiasm was slightly lower than with some of the other meals I ve made this year on Cook 90 I m wondering if I could jazz them up a bit with some more interesting spices This could easily be served on lettuce leaves if desired	freeze

0.0	0.0	Flawless I have made a lot of veggie burgers but this was by far the best So happy I have four more in the freezer waiting for me I used a food processor for the mushrooms and my chickpeas had been frozen and thawed twice making them border on mushy so the burgers were very soft but they stayed together pretty well

0.0	0.0	This is a superb recipe As long as you don t burden a veggie burger with the need to taste like beef you will enjoy the heck out of this Its got a meaty texture and with the requisite condiments is highly satisfying I didn t find mashing the chickpeas and mushrooms a good method so i gave them a few quick pulses in the food processor Just don t over process it should be chunky Based on other advice I cooked lower and a bit longer and likes the crust effect it produced Because it was a new recipe I cut it in half Which means we ate two and still have two in the freezer Next time I ll make the full recipe and have more on hand
