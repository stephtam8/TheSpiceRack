0.0	0.0	Oh my What a wonderful and unique dessert I used cocoa powder coconut milk and cinnamon and then put shredded coconut on top It didn t rise as much as it shows in the picture but that was okay gave more crunchy to go with the spongy Everyone loved it I did take others suggestions and used only 1 cup of sugar That was plenty I will try it with matcha and cardamom next

0.0	0.0	We did half vanilla coconut half chocolate and loved both lots I had never baked with mochi flour before so this was a really fun discovery Though we baked all of it in muffin tins and highly enjoyed all the crunchy texture as other cooks have noted that wonderful crunch fades by the very next day I m still trying to decide whether the extra work of oiling we used cooking spray btw sugaring the tins cleaning them all out afterwards if that was worth the delightful muffin texture if the texture lasted longer than one night I d say definitely Next time I might try the ease of the brownie pan if only to test how much I actually miss the muffin tin crunch PS has anyone tried freezing these I know the crunch would be gone but does anything else happen texture wise

0.0	0.0	OMG this is pro at the mot interesting cake I ve ever made I love almost anything mochi but never thought I could actually make it Now I know I can Two things in the recipe I would change though my husband said to leave it be it is already perfect I think I would only use 1 cup of sugar It s really too sweet and I LOVE sweets I didn t have any plain matcha powder so I just emptied out two matcha tea bags and voila it was perfect Not too strong and not too weak I also used half black sesame seeds and half regular Made it pretty with the green inside I think I will definitely go to all the trouble to make the cupcake sized version next time because if you like chewy sticky sweets this would be the best way to achieve that in every piece As for me I have a feeling the cake will not last 5 days in my kitchen Unless someone hides it I ll be enjoying every single bite

0.0	0.0	Just made this and my goodness it was amazing The combo I did coconut oil coconut milk cocoa cinnamon a grating of nutmeg shredded coconut on top I baked it in muffing tins Things I might change for next time 1 The muffin tins did indeed create an amazing contrast of textures but were a bit fiddly to oil and sugar I ll try to bake it in a square tin I think the contrast of textures will be similar to a brownie between the edges and the centre 2 I dropped some chocolate chips into each muffin tin but the mostly sank to the bottom I ll either leave them out or put them on top of the coconut topping to see if that helps hold them aloft I m eager to try other variations perhaps matcha and Ovaltine for a malted green tea flavour

0.0	0.0	Just made this and my goodness we loved it The combo I did Coconut oil coconut milk cocoa cinnamon a grating of nutmeg shredded coconut on top Despite all the coconut it was not overly coconutty which is a plus in my book as I was simply trying make them dairy free Things I might change next time 1 I baked it in muffin tins which does create an amazing ratio of textures but was a bit fiddly to do between the oiling and sugaring of each muffin cup I will be trying it next time in a square tin to try and mimic the way a brownie gives you different textures between the edges and the centre 2 I dropped some chocolate chips into each muffin cup but found they mostly sank to the bottom I ll try it next time without them or maybe try and put them on top of the coconut topping to see if it helps to hold them up I m very eager to try other flavours I m thinking I might try to combine matcha with a bit of Ovaltine for a malted green tea flavour

0.0	0.0	Chewy and gooey and yummy We love these I made them with cocoa cinnamon half and half and coconut I made it as muffins and had two pans One was a darker non stick pan and the other was a lighter colored regular pan The non stick came out darker and crunchier on the outside Next time I would only use the non stick Full disclosure I have eaten 4 already and they came out of the over 40 minutes ago I am incapable of waiting for things to cool completely

0.0	0.0	Made with butter coconut milk cardamom and just the Koda rice flour no other powdered ingredient also zest from one orange which didn t provide a discernible flavor Forgot the topping I made cupcakes and a small loaf using a 1 4 cup scoop it made a dozen cupcakes and had five scoops left for the loaf At 45 minutes the cupcakes were just on the okay side of a bit scorched due to the sugar lining of the pan I gave the loaf another 15 minutes very hard to tell if when it was done The cupcakes came out of the tin okay but the cake was hard to remove next time I would line the pan with parchment Unusual and delicious combination of crunch and gooey centers

0.0	0.0	I made this mochi 3 days ago I used two muffin pans 14 muffin cups as suggested It turned out absolutely fabulous I want to make more right now We are an Asian family with my husband being Japanese American from Hawaii and the rest of us being from Taiwan or Taiwanese American There are many styles and consistencies of mochi between and within Asian cultures We enjoy the solid yet gooey chew of this mochi more than the less dense nature of the chew in traditional Hawaiian butter mochi I used taro powder and cinnamon as well as roasted sesame seeds on top and the resulting outside crunch was amazing It added a unique value to this mochi dessert that my family loved and that I have never had in traditional mochis of Japan Taiwan and China Next time I will use less sugar I also noticed that the two mochi that were in the two muffin cups by themselves in the 2nd muffin pan were much more crunchy all around while the other 12 mochi in the 1st pan were mainly crunchy just on top Makes sense Next time I will divide my batter more evenly between the two muffin pans 7 mochi in each pan because we liked the crunch just on top All around surface area crunch was good to begin with but over the next two days the crunch becomes chewier and it can be distracting to chew through all that crust if it is all around I am so glad I have this recipe to make mochi bites from now on Next time I am going to try ube extract because the taro powder I used was too subtle for me

0.0	0.0	I used coconut milk One cup of sugar was sweet enough for me Made six chocolate cupcakes per daughter and a 6 green tea cake for me Added 1 T cocoa powder for six cupcakes and 1 T green tea powder to the 6 cake batter Next time I will increase baking time by 5 7 min The center was soft and tasted underbaked Very easy and forgiving recipe

0.0	0.0	I appreciate the creative license this recipe gives the baker I made the cupcake version but it didn t come out to the same consistency as butter mochi spongey glutinous texture It was a bit drier and tasted more like a pound cake I think it s because it only calls for 2 eggs and 1 can of coconut milk rather than 4 eggs and 1 can coconut milk 1 can evap milk like the usual butter mochi recipe I make the Filipino Hawaiian version my family uses Recipe also says you can add cinnamon turmeric or cardamom which is weird to add a traditional butter mochi Though it tasted good just beware that it isn t necessarily an authentic butter mochi recipe
