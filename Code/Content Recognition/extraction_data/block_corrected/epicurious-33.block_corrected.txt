0.0	0.0	Fish can be intimidating for those who didn t grow up cooking or eating it One of the best ways to ease people into eating anything unfamiliar is by smothering it in roasted garlic and cheese Forget the old Italian maxim of not mixing seafood and cheese they pair magically and make first forays into cooking and eating halibut easy to execute and even easier to eat

0.0	0.0	This was great I didn t have a whole garlic head and only roasted four medium smallish cloves and it was still very garlicky Roasting really brings out the strength of the garlic flavor I blended the mayo parmesan mixture with some lime juice maybe a half teaspoon and I felt like that improved the topping mixture I also covered the fish with breadcrumbs for that final four minute broil It felt like it needed some crunchy texture toasted almonds could have been good too One other thing I did was to add green beans the thin french kind around the fish as it baked and broiled cooking it along with the fish I served this dish over wild rice

0.0	0.0	I ve made this a handful of times over the past few months and it s fast once the garlic is roasted easy and delicious I even made it once without the garlic because I was too lazy to go to the store and it was still pretty good though the garlic does make it better It is rich so I serve the fish on a big bed of greens spinach usually

0.0	0.0	This is simple and delicious I think it could be made with many different white fish I ve made it with halibut but during coronavirus ended up only being able to get cod I adjusted the cooking time and it was still really good It takes longer to brown than stated but didn t hurt the texture of the fish Yum

0.0	0.0	vae9106 Unfortunately some people don t make a dish before they review it and some people change so many of the original ingredients that their reviews aren t helpful It doesn t appear that you made the recipe before you corrected for other reviewers shortcomings and your corrections of other peoples opinions might not be accurate People who read reviews can probably figure this out and adjust for themselves And many just look at reviews for recommended adjustments which I find to be helpful in more complicated dishes This is a real review I loved this super easy dish and am always looking for an easy way to cook fish on a weeknight Can one possibly find fresher fish that doesn t need sauce Or a more creative preparation Of course but this is great for what it is a beginner level fish recipe

0.0	0.0	I grew up in Nova Scotia and Norway Beautiful fresh fish so doesn t need garlic It actually needs very little Try fresh lobster with melted butter and french bread I am now in Louisiana and they really get it Yes some recipes like broiled oysters at Drapo s have garlic but you can ask for them without it It s just about how fresh the seafood is and knowing how to cook it Fish is about method not a lot of crap overwhelming it
