0.0	0.0	Original Boat Street Café owner Susan Kaplan handed this recipe down to me when I took the reins and although it s changed over the years it s still a favorite The method is a bit unusual I dress unpeeled juicy peaches with lemon zest then smear the batter on top followed by a dousing of sugar and a bit of hot water The result is a delicate crackly crust unrivaled in the world of cobblers Use the same crust to top summer berries if you prefer

0.0	0.0	Peel the fruit this was easy and tasty a great easy option in peach season agree that less sugar is better brings out the taste of the peaches and I added powdered ginger and a bit of chopped crystalized ginger because they re such a great compliment to peaches

0.0	0.0	Way too sweet I tolerate sugar much better as I ve gotten older but this was a sugar bomb In it s favor the crunch topping was really outstanding and unique Will I make it again yes it is just unique enough for a crowd I added blueberries to the peaches bad idea They took away from the peachy goodness make sure you liberally use the lemon and zest Used some vanilla Not so sure that was a good idea Will leave it out Bottom line tweak this dessert

0.0	0.0	Not sure why everyone gives this great reviews when they say they ve modified the recipe I halved the recipe thank goodness and had to use less sugar on the top when it was obvious the full amount was way too much It was still horribly sweet I also agree with another reviewer not enough pastry either I understand the idea of this cobbler is to let the peaches shine but even a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg would have added some much needed flavor The only thing interesting was the crunchy top The hot water crust is what made me want to try this I would not make this again there are much better ways to use delicious summer peaches

0.0	0.0	This was anazing 1 2 d the recipe and made it with fresh cherries because that s what I had It was incredible For anyone complaining about the amount of sugar just cut back on it a bit depending on the sweetness of the fruit The sugar on top with hot water was weird but it TOTALLY WORKED amazing crunchy sugary crust balanced by the cakey goodness and summer fruit I used 1 2 the amount of sugar in the topping and it was delightful Will def put this into regular dresser rotation and looking forward to some fall fruit change ups

0.0	0.0	I thought I would try this recipe as I was intrigued by the hot water technique used to create a crispy crust That actually did work but I was so disappointed that the amount of sugar called for was so excessive thereby ruining the outcome I usually follow a recipe as written the first time around and then if worthy I modify it to my taste the next time I make it Tasted it out of the fridge this morning There s a lot leftover May be able to use spoonfuls as a topping for ice cream but eating it straight is cloyingly sweet and I have no aversion to sugar or sweet desserts My peaches were ripe juicy and fairly sweet I didn t expect this outcome

0.0	0.0	This recipe is wonderful The brûlée like crust is perfect and just by using sugar and hot water no butane torch I always add my own slight adaptations it s just a habit so I added some peach snaps to the peaches and some vanilla to the dough Neither were necessary as the recipe is great as in but I like to get a bit creative Thankyou so much I know this will become one of those recipes handed down from generation to generation
