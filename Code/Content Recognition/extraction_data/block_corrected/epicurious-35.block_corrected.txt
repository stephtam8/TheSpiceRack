0.0	0.0	The pan size worked perfectly for me I m at a high altitude though Could that make a difference I ve made this four times and loved it every time with the exception that there is not enough glaze and I thought the glaze too sweet There is no way you can match the photo if you use the amount of glaze in the recipe After the first time I made it I ve used lemon instead of orange juice for the glaze I left out the bee pollen since I first tried this when shopping was difficult in the Spring although I recently bought some and am curious as to whether that will make a difference I was puzzled that a reviewer thought the coffee grounds were gritty I grind coffee myself and perhaps I grind it more finely than pre ground coffee Since there are just the two of us I always give part of my baking to neighbors This recipe was a huge hit

0.0	0.0	So I read some of the reviews prior to making and decided to tweak the recipe according to some of them I used almonds instead of pecans because it was the only nut I had on hand and I toasted them in a skillet before combining them with the streusel mixture I reduced the amount of coffee to 1 tbsp Because everyone kept saying that the recipe made too much batter as written I adjusted all the cake ingredient amounts to 3 4 of their original amounts I also browned half of the butter which I HIGHLY recommend you do too I also used 3 4 cup of white sugar and 1 4 cup of brown sugar in the cake I also saved a couple tbsps of the streusel mixture to sprinkle on top before baking instead of making the glaze It tastes delicious and more complex than your average coffee cake

0.0	0.0	Okay So I prepared this loaf with several changes It now has a nice flavor profile and lovely crumb First as everyone aleady knows the pan size as directed in the recipe is way off I used a large All Clad loaf pan 10 x 5 with a shiny finish didn t want the bottom of loaf to burn CHANGES TO STREUSEL INGREDIENTS Increased pecan volume to 1 1 4 C Increased DARK brown not light sugar to 1 2 C Reduced SEA SALT not Kosher to 1 2 tsp Omitted bee pollen more on that at end of comment Reduced ESPRESSO POWDER not finely ground coffee to 1 1 2 tsp Added 1 2 tsp freshly ground nutmeg Reduced ground fennel seeds to 1 tsp Substituted powdered orange peel with fresh orange zest All other streusel ingredients were the same and I really liked the flavor nothing overwhelmed Tasted great CHANGES TO LOAF INGREDIENTS Reduced SEA SALT not Kosher to 1 4 tsp Substituted sour cream with plain non Greek yogurt CHANGES TO PREPARATION Did not use parchment Generously buttered loaf pan As suggested by a couple of the commenters here I divided the streusel in two and used half on the bottom of the buttered loaf pan and the other half in the middle of the batter AND I REMOVED 1 2 CUP OF BATTER FROM BOWL BEFORE ADDING TO LOAF PAN This recipe simply makes too much batter even for a large All Clad loaf pan I followed the rest of the recipe as shown My loaf baked to a beautiful crumb in 78 minutes And I had no trouble turning loaf out onto wire rack And it s DELICIOUS Re Bee Pollen Really Who has bee pollen in the pantry And today when bees are more endangered than ever which in turn endangers our entire global food supply it seems irresponsible to be harvesting pollen from these incredibly industrious food partners The more we interfere with their life cycle the more we risk the possibility for their demise And without the bees we are goners Just sayin

0.0	0.0	This was a great sour cream coffee cake base I ended up adding 30 more pecans into the streusel It was very moist and had an excellent crunchy sugary crust all around Would definitely make again maybe with less coffee in the struesel next time it was definitely a kick

0.0	0.0	I made the spice mix with out the bee pollen and orange peel 1 teaspoon of salt was waaayyy too much In fact it overpowered the spice mix and in my opinion ruined the cake The recommended cake pan was too small Despite the review recommendations I used anyway with a cookie sheet to catch the spillage because I just didn t want to believe that the recipe author would make such a basic mistake I have to assume that Tara O Brady kloodged two recipes together and didn t test

0.0	0.0	In the middle of the corona virus the only way I m going to find bee pollen is by chasing a bee The ingredient is not available in Luxembourg So instead of the spice mix I added 1 2 teas Cinnamon and some pumpkin spice mix And then I tasted The streusel mix doesn t change in the baking so making a taste we like was just fine less exotic but delicious

0.0	0.0	Like many others I did not have bee pollen but I did purchase it specifically for this recipe since it has some health benefits Before I did however I looked up other recipes that used bee pollen and found some good ones to try I too had a major problem with the pan size and my cake overflowed and burned in the bottom of my oven not happy about that mess or the smell For my oven the baking time was too long and my cake is dry I like the overall flavor profiles and will try it again with these adjustments use a large loaf pan or a bundt pan as someone else suggested a little less salt in the streusel and triple the glaze as it is way too little FYI if you make half the amount of Savory to Sweet Coffee Spice Mix you will have the perfect amount for the Streusel and not end up with a left over amount to store So for me I will give this one more chance and if it isn t successful then that s it for this recipe

0.0	0.0	This did not work for me The cake part was good but the coffee spice mixture was a fail 3 Tab of ground coffee was way to much I felt like I was chewing the bottom of the coffee pot When eating it I kept wishing I had put in a traditional strudel mixture Lets put it this way there are two men in my house and I told them to have it and still the cake sits on the counter

0.0	0.0	It hasn t come out of the oven yet but I am afraid it may taste a bit smoked based on how my house smells at the moment Pan size way way too small I almost used a Bundt cake pan and regret trying to follow the instructions to a tee Also the cooking time for this in a loaf pan filled to the rim at 325 has so far been 120 mins And it is still not done If I am able to update this after it has been eaten I will otherwise based on these two very significant misstatements pan size and cooking time temp I can only give two stars

0.0	0.0	This recipe adapts well to GF flour I used the cup for cup kind Was able to make from my pantry staples no bee pollen cinnamon cardammon or pecans I used nutmeg and walnuts and made my own orange peel and juice from our backyard oranges II agree with one reviewer that the glazing is not necessary I will make again with proper ingredients but probably sans bee pollen Thank Epi

0.0	0.0	Would leave four forks only if I followed the recipe exactly Supplies in the grocery store are limited during a pandemic so I used what I had in the pantry for the spice mix cinnamon cardamom and instant coffee In addition I used a mixture of almonds and pistachios since I didn t have any pecans I am sure any nuts will do The rest of the recipe I followed exactly The family loved it I had to threaten to hide the loaf after the first serving since I wanted the remainder to last for dessert the following night Don t know if any cake will be left by dinner tomorrow

0.0	0.0	The good news is that this cake tastes good and even better the next day The bad news is that the recipe has some significant flaws First the suggested pan size is way too small for the amount of batter this recipe makes I didn t figure this out until half the batter and the spice mix were in the pan so I filled the pan to the top with the remaining batter and put a baking sheet under the pan to catch the inevitable overflow Second the cake looks nothing like the photo The top did not dome maybe because the pan was too small And the glaze recipe yielded far too little glaze to glaze the top never mind drip down the sides Finally although I made this to use up some sour cream hanging around my fridge the bee pollen and dried orange peel can hardly be called staples I made the spice mix without them and it s fine but both the article that accompanied this recipe and the recipe itself could have used more editing

0.0	0.0	My family has been making a particular sour cream coffee cake since the 1940s that is very similar but we ve traditionally used walnuts and just cinnamon The biggest difference though is that we forgo the parchment just grease the pan then put half the nut sugar mixture in the bottom of the pan add half the batter on top of that the rest of the nut sugar then the rest of the batter When you turn it out of the pan you plate it bottom up No need for a glaze and that slight crunch you get from where the sugar has been in direct contact with the hot pan in the oven is so wonderful
