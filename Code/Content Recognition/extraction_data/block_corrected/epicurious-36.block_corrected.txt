0.0	0.0	Probably should have given this 3 stars as my partner enjoyed but even then it didn t start from 4 stars so if I were to repeat unlikely and not because it s difficult which its not I d add a lot more cabbage But I really don t think that would improve it Not sure the purpose of the egg I used a duck egg so conceivably that impacted the recipe but doubt it Lots more herbs less egg loose and flavorful mashed potatoes and lots more caramelized onions and cabbage is the only way I d redo

0.0	0.0	This was yummy but took closer to two hours versus an hour to make It could easily be a main dish If I make it again I would try to cut down on the amount of fat in this dish I think the last 2 tbl of butter were basically unnecessary If you want to celebrate St Patrick s day but don t want to eat corned beef or are a vegetarian make this Someone suggested using mushrooms instead of the bacon

0.0	0.0	Granted this one takes a bit of effort but what else can I do amid social distancing It was not just amazingly beautiful It was delicious as well Followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of 2 chopped garlic cloves cooked with the onions and sliced cabbage Fully caramelizing the onion cabbage mixture is a must It adds character to the mashed potatoes

0.0	0.0	This was very good but I didn t plunge the cabbage in cold water to cool off since water isn t as readily available in this part of the country Will cut recipe in half next time since this was SO much for just 2 people
