0.0	0.0	With flavors that straddle the thrilling line between salty and sweet winter squash and pumpkin are incredibly versatile pairing easily with a wide range of flavors and spices In this ramen recipe I use miso paste in two different ways slathering it on the squash before it roasts and mixing it into the broth where it amplifies both the sweet and savory character of the squash The real game changer is blending some of the roasted squash into the broth delivering velvety rich body You can use other types of squash or pumpkins for this dish but because of its robust flesh nutty flavor and meaty mouthfeel Japanese kabocha is my preferred choice butternut squash is a worthy substitute		
0.0	0.0	If you like you can roast the squash seeds and use them as a topper for your ramen To do this wash the seeds to remove the innards and toss in the miso paste along with the squash Roast alongside the squash You ll need to watch the seeds as they may get brown and crispy before the squash is ready

0.0	0.0	Unfortunately there is no health benefit using miso in this way You need to add miso after done cooking or you will kill the bacteria which is the probiotic benefit of miso otherwise it just adds a mild but mostly salt flavor People see the word Miso and think this will be a healthy recipe unfortunately there is no benefit in using miso in this recipe

0.0	0.0	Great fall recipe perfect comfort food for a gloomy day Used fresh ramen noodles available at WF and sweet dumpling squash about 2 5lbs including seeds and skin Did not have the issues described by other reviewers all portions as described in the recipe were accurate To make it easier kept the squash skin on until after baking The kept the skin on for garnish squash scooped out the squash sans skin for the broth puree The flavor of the caramelized Miso paste on the baked squash was delicious Added chopped green onions to garnish

0.0	0.0	I made this today for my husband who makes a killer ramen recipe of his own and he wasn t sold The squash puree sauce which is really a soup doesn t really go with ramen Maybe penne I used some of the leftover squash puree there was a LOT and used it as a sauce for a lasagna The rest will be soup Overall a lot of work and not a great result
