0.0	0.0	Our double chocolate cookie is to me the perfect cookie It s extremely chocolatey and rich full of both dark chocolate chunks and bits of unsweetened chocolate The cookie part itself is chewy and soft and when you get one of the slightly caramelized edge pieces it s really amazing At Flour we launched a whole grain campaign to introduce more whole grains into our baking and this was the first pastry we changed Granted these could never be considered health food However if you are going to bake why not use a whole grain flour to make it incrementally better for you and better tasting Rye flour is a bit nutty and offers more flavor than all purpose flour adding it to this cookie dough has the subtle effect of making the cookie slightly less sweet and showcasing the chocolate flavor even more

0.0	0.0	A winner VERY chocolate y and a bit fussy but worth it As others noted I dropped the sugar to my taste 1 1 4 cup Warned by some reviews I withheld about 1 tablespoon of the flour It may depend on how much moisture the whole grain flour absorbed before using it Turned out well

0.0	0.0	I LOVED these cookies My family loved them and they were pretty easy to make The flavor is great and they so chocolatey I was really worried that I did something wrong with the dough because it was really liquid but once I put it in the fridge for about 2 hours it was perfect For me it took longer to bake than they said about 17 20 mins but I also made my cookies pretty big What I recommend is adding about double the walnuts because I think they make the cookies way better but it s still amazing with the normal amount

0.0	0.0	Haven t made it yet I m confused by the instruction Chop the remaining 4 ounces bittersweet chocolate into 1 inch chunks Surely it is not 1 cubes I usually cook with Scharffen Berger which is a thick bar unless I need chocolate chips which hold their shape in the cookie What chocolate is recommended to chop up like this

0.0	0.0	These were great I cut the sugar by 20 grams or so and used some 85 and some 70 for the bittersweet chocolate and used a bit less baking powder as I m at altitude I let the dough sit in the fridge for around 36 hours it s sticky but worth the mess I also weighed it out in 40g ish portions and baked for 12 14 mins it ll depend on your oven I recommend They re super deep richly flavored a great cookie when you just need one
