0.0	0.0	This recipe is inspired by the grilled chicken served at Jeerapan a 77 year old restaurant in Bangkok Thailand Their version is baked in a tandoor like oven but I ve adapted it for a grill or oven The two stage cooking method is essential The initial roasting at moderate heat partially cooks the meat while dehydrating the skin getting it ready to crisp up later on and allowing all the scattered bits of fresh aromatics and dried spices in the marinade to adhere The final stage of cooking is hot and fast using saffron infused coconut oil as a basting liquid The end result is a juicy fragrant and intensely flavorful bird tinted canary gold its skin smoky charred and crisp The pineapple chile dipping sauce lends its sweet tang and a mild kick of heat to round out the meal		
0.0	0.0	There are myriad styles of grilled chicken in Thailand what makes this one stand out is that its seasoning ingredients include both common fresh Thai herbs as well as dried spices that are more frequently seen in Middle Eastern and South Asian cuisines such as cardamom cinnamon allspice and saffron You can eat this chicken with coconut rice Thai Muslim style or you can eat it with sticky rice which is the most common companion to grilled chicken in Thailand

0.0	0.0	What do you mean by Muslim Style Is there such a thing as Christian Style There are Muslims living all over the world in almost every country from very different cultures and and with different food influences They don t all use the same spices and ingredients You can t lump them all together and call it Muslim style Very poor choice of name for this dish

0.0	0.0	OMG This was amazing Even my teenage daughter very picky eater and typically doesn t like anything I cook loves it The chicken was moist and bursting with flavor The pineapple sauce complimented the complex flavors of the chicken perfectly This is not a week night meal In fact I didn t read the recipe thoroughly and missed the 12 24 hr marinade requirement until I had already started So there went Sunday dinner I grilled it on Monday I used a big green egg grill and I can t say enough This was a wonderful meal I will definitely make this again

0.0	0.0	OMG so delicious My husband said it might be the best chicken he s ever had And the pineapple sauce was fantastic It took a fair amount of effort not something I d attempt on a weeknight after work but the results were well worth it The chicken also looked beautiful when we pulled it off the grill it would be a showpiece dish for company especially if we doubled the recipe and used 2 chickens I ll definitely be making this again

0.0	0.0	This is a really nice dish I made two small chickens with the spice rub which worked just fine for our palate The sauce is well worth making and maybe even doubling as it would make a nice sweet sour sauce for many things It is a little more involved than the usual grilled chicken but a good change of pace I think I would spatchcock my usual way next time though I missed the chicken backs for soup

0.0	0.0	This was absolutely delicious Flavors were amazing and technique on the gas grill worked perfectly To cut back on a few steps I used fresh ground black pepper in the marinade and simply crushed the saffron as I added it to the pan Used only 1 Serrano chili in the sauce

0.0	0.0	I would disagree that this recipe is too involved Most of the prep time was for making the spice paste The rest is just cooking time We did not marinate the chicken overnight and the flavor still came out great We did everything in the kitchen including the dhungar method which worked like a charm and added a lot of great smokiness to the taste
