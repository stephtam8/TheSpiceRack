0.0	0.0	Let s clear something up right away New York City isn t the only place in the world to get decent authentic bagels The truth is you can make bagels that are just as good at home no matter where you live They re one of the simplest breads to make requiring only flour water salt yeast and malt and one secret ingredient time in the form of long slow cold fermentation Any decent bagel shop knows this and uses an overnight method to stretch out the fermentation process releasing all sorts of subtle flavors trapped in the flour While bagel shops often use a type of high protein flour not available to home cooks to achieve that distinctively chewy texture regular unbleached bread flour can also do the trick The real key is to use a much lower percentage of water than is used for baguettes and other European hearth breads producing a stiff dough that can stand up to a dunking in boiling water before going into the oven More than any ingredient or other aspect of the method this boiling step is what defines the uniqueness of the bagel That said bagels do usually feature one other distinctive ingredient barley malt While this may seem like an exotic hard to find product it s actually commonly available at most supermarkets usually labeled barley malt syrup If you can t find it simply substitute an equal amount of honey Your bagels might not have that malty flavor but they ll still be better than almost any bagel you can buy One final note If you like bagels but don t want to set up the boiling operation for just six of them feel free to double the size of the batch and bake enough to freeze for future use

0.8024596464258262	0.0	Preparation Do ahead To make the dough stir the malt syrup yeast and salt into the lukewarm water Place the flour into a mixing bowl and pour in the malt syrup mixture If using a mixer use the dough hook and mix on the lowest speed for 3 minutes If mixing by hand use a large sturdy spoon and stir for about 3 minutes until well blended The dough should form a stiff coarse ball and the flour should be fully hydrated if it isn t stir in a little more water Let the dough rest for 5 minutes Resume mixing with the dough hook on the lowest speed for another 3 minutes or transfer to a very lightly floured work surface and knead by hand for about 3 minutes to smooth out the dough and develop the gluten The dough should be stiff yet supple with a satiny barely tacky feel If the dough seems too soft or overly tacky mix or knead in a little more flour Place the dough in a clean lightly oiled bowl cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature for 1 hour When you re ready to shape the bagels prepare a sheet pan by lining it with parchment paper or a silicone mat then misting it with spray oil or lightly coating it with oil Divide the dough into 6 to 8 equal pieces A typical bagel is about 4 ounces or 113 grams before baking but you can make them smaller If you make more than 6 bagels you may need to prepare 2 sheet pans Form each piece into a loose ball by rolling it on a clean dry work surface with a cupped hand Don t use any flour on the work surface If the dough slides around and won t ball up wipe the surface with a damp paper towel and try again the slight bit of moisture will provide enough traction for the dough to form into a ball There are two methods to shape the balls into bagels The first method is to poke a hole through the center of the ball to create a donut shape Holding the dough with both thumbs in the hole rotate the dough with your hands gradually stretching it to create a hole about 2 inches in diameter The second method preferred by professional bagel makers is to use both hands and a fair amount of pressure to roll the ball into a rope about 8 inches long on a clean dry work surface Again wipe the surface with a damp towel if necessary to create sufficient friction on the work surface Taper the rope slightly at each end and moisten the last inch or so of the ends Place one end of the dough in the palm of your hand and wrap the rope around your hand to complete the circle going between your thumb and forefinger and then all the way around The ends should overlap by about 2 inches Squeeze the overlapping ends together by closing your hand then press the seam into the work surface rolling it back and forth a few times to seal Remove the dough from your hand squeezing it to even out the thickness if need be and creating a hole of about 2 inches in diameter Place each shaped bagel on the prepared sheet pan then mist with spray oil or brush with a light coating of oil Cover the entire pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or for up to 2 days You can also proof the full piece of dough in the oiled bowl overnight and then shape the bagels on baking day 60 to 90 minutes before boiling and baking them or as soon as they pass the float test On baking day Remove the bagels from the refrigerator 60 to 90 minutes before you plan to bake them and if you plan to top them with dried onion or garlic rehydrate those ingredients see the variations Immediately check whether the bagels are ready for baking using the float test Place one of the bagels in a small bowl of cold water If it sinks and doesn t float back to the surface shake it off return it to the pan and wait for another 15 to 20 minutes then test it again When one bagel passes the float test they re all ready to be boiled If they pass the float test before you are ready to boil and bake them return them to the refrigerator so they don t overproof About 30 minutes before baking preheat the oven to 500 F 260 C and gather and prepare your garnishes seeds onions garlic and so on To make the poaching liquid fill a pot with 2 to 3 quarts 64 to 96 oz 181 to 272 g of water making sure the water is at least 4 inches deep Cover bring to a boil then lower the heat to maintain at a simmer Stir in the malt syrup baking soda and salt Gently lower each bagel into the simmering poaching liquid adding as many as will comfortably fit in the pot They should all float to the surface within 15 seconds After 1 minute use a slotted spoon to turn each bagel over Poach for another 30 to 60 seconds then use the slotted spoon to transfer it back to the pan domed side up It s important that the parchment paper be lightly oiled or the paper will glue itself to the dough as the bagels bake Sprinkle on a generous amount of whatever toppings you like as soon as the bagels come out of the water except cinnamon sugar see the variation for details Transfer the pan of bagels to the oven then lower the oven heat to 450 F 232 C Bake for 8 minutes then rotate the pan and check the underside of the bagels If they re getting too dark place another pan under the baking sheet Doubling the pan will insulate the first baking sheet Bake for another 8 to 12 minutes until the bagels are a golden brown Cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing or serving Variations You can replace any amount of the bread flour with an equal amount of whole grain flour by weight such as wheat or rye If you do so increase the water in the dough by 1 tablespoon 0 5 oz 14 g for every 2 ounces 56 5 g of whole grain flour you substitute Top your bagels with any combination of the following garnishes poppy seeds sesame seeds coarse salt or rehydrated dried onions or garlic Soak dried onions or garlic in water to cover for at least 1 hour before applying The toppings will stick even better if you first brush the top of each bagel with an egg white wash made by whisking 1 egg white with 1 tablespoon 0 5 oz 14 g of water If using coarse salt as a garnish remember that a little goes a long way For raisin bagels mix in 1 1 3 cups 8 oz 227 g of raisins during the final 2 minutes of mixing and if you like cinnamon stir 1 2 teaspoon 0 14 oz 4 g of ground cinnamon into the flour before you start mixing When the bagels come out of the oven brush the tops with melted butter and dip the top into a bed of cinnamon sugar to give it a very tasty cinnamon crust You can make cinnamon sugar by whisking 2 tablespoons 1 6 oz 44 g of ground cinnamon into 1 2 cup 4 oz 113 g of granulated sugar	To make the dough stir the malt syrup yeast and salt into the lukewarm water Place the flour into a mixing bowl and pour in the malt syrup mixture If using a mixer use the dough hook and mix on

0.0	0.0	Who would ever think that the time would come when you cannot get a decent bagel in Miami Beach Well now you can from my kitchen Amazing flavor from the barley malt I used poppy seeds which now of course are in every corner of my home I m clumsy But I digress I have never used instant yeast but I wanted to make these as directed I think that I over kneaded the dough a bit using my Kitchenaid We have simply awful tap water I used bottled for the recipe tap for the poach Six bagels are the right size eight would be too small I did not get enough of a crust which suggests I think that I need to mist or use the ice cube method I have a horrid electric oven The diastatic malt powder might be a bit easier to work with than the syrup I obtained the syrup at Whole Foods The powder is available from Amazon I can barely wait to make this recipe again I haven t had a bagel this good in years
