0.0	0.0	With all the other side dishes on your Thanksgiving table does your stuffing recipe really need all those extras Leave the sausage nuts and dried fruit behind in favor of this easy vegetarian friendly mix of torn country bread and classic Thanksgiving herbs To make it vegetarian use vegetable broth Baking the mix in a casserole dish on the side of your bird technically makes it dressing instead of stuffing but you can call it whatever you want

0.0	0.0	Wow I love dressing and have eaten my family s recipes for years For 2020 my wife and isolated and celebrated Turkey Day together We used this recipe and Holy Cow Amazing Takes me too childhood and incredible flavors then brings me back to adulthood where I understand the complexity and simplicity of flavors You can taste the sage thyme and rosemary independently then meld together Complex and simple Thanksgiving in a bite 5 Star for sure My new go to thanks to the chef that posted this delight

0.0	0.0	This recipe is everything you want in stuffing It s crispy on top and mushy in the middle The only change I made was to use dried herbs so I cut the measurements in half I used a good artisanal white bread a bit of challah and some leftover hamburger buns I would recommend this in a heartbeat soooooo good

0.0	0.0	KEITHNJ There are 2 stages of baking in this recipe stage 1 is to bake covered 350 for 40 minutes to actually cook the dressing stage 2 browning is to take off the cover then bake for an additional 40 45 minutes If making ahead do the first bake aka step 1 let it cool down refrigerate Then on the day of serving do step 2 but add extra baking time because the dish will be colder out of the fridge than if you d done step 2 immediately after step 1

0.005797101449275362	0.0	I assume that diamond crystal kosher Salt is used for this recipe If you have table salt just cut the amount in half You need to keep in mind that low sodium chicken stock Which is what the recipe clearly specifies has about 72 mg of sodium per cup and reduced sodium chicken stock has about 555 mg of sodium per cup So if you are using reduced sodium chicken stock instead of low sodium you need to reduce the salt by a half teaspoon if you are using table salt and a full teaspoon if you are using kosher salt So the new amounts would be 1 teaspoon of Diamond crystal kosher salt And 1 2 teaspoon table salt But really it would be best if you would just follow the Recipe and use low sodium not reduce sodium chicken stock The recipe is great if you actually do what it says I wanted a crisp top so I baked it covered for 30 minutes and then I uncovered it and baked it for 15 minutes more To whoever developed this it was amazing The spice ratio is perfect The consistency is perfect Even though it uses a lot of butter it doesn t taste too buttery at all I have also frozen it before baking so then I can bake it later if I want I just unbag and unwrap the frozen block of stuffing put it in the same casserole dish again let it thaw overnight in the fridge and then let it come up to room temperature as it sits on the stove while the oven preheats I m not sure how much sodium is in homemade chicken Stock so you would have to figure that out and do what I suggested above to make sure that your salt is still correct but I think this would be really good with homemade chicken stock This truly is the best recipe I have tried and if you keep that caveat in mind that I mentioned it will be great for you too	15 minutes
