0.0	0.0	The trick for getting a crackling crispy skin on the potatoes is egg whites a technique I started using back at ABC Kitchen You want to whip the whites until they re foamy and no liquid remains in the bowl then add the potatoes toss them until well coated and strain away any excess before adding any seasoning This technique works best with tiny young new potatoes which have a thin skin that crisps up easily If you can t find truly small new potatoes grab the smallest fingerlings or baby russets you can find and adjust the timing accordingly		
0.0	0.0	Editor s note The cooking time will depend entirely on the size of your potatoes many cooks have found that their potatoes took 20 minutes or more

0.0	0.0	Maybe reviewers who complained about cooking time ought to check their ovens temperatures or measure the size of their potatoes I have been roasting Whole Foods baby potatoes which are about 1 inch exactly for years at 400 and it takes 15 minutes exactly if the oven is preheated to 400 before putting the potatoes in

0.0	0.0	These potatoes came out less crispy than when I just use oil to roast them They were less flavorful and the egg whites that stuck to the parchment made a burnt mess Not worth the effort

0.0	0.0	I had minor issues with mine Keeping in mind the previous review I set my timer for the maximum time 20 minutes I d set my oven to 425 on convection because that s kinda my favorite for roasting potatoes I followed the directions regarding the egg whites and the spacing on the parchment covered sheet pan I only seasoned with salt and pepper because I have some picky eaters in my assortment I gave them an extra five minutes at the 425 convection These were pretty fabulous and will definitely get a repeat The excess egg white turns into a crust reminiscent of pork rinds I m very interested in working with this in the future and seeing how I can tweak it Really quite pleased with the initial result
