0.0	0.0	Chef Erick Williams didn t really like mac and cheese until he and his sous chef spent a few years perfecting this recipe for his Chicago restaurant Virtue The thing about it that converted Williams into a fan It s silky and creamy throughout with almost no crispy bits the chef is generally against cheese getting crunchy Don t be fooled by the fact that a hot oven is involved here this is really a stovetop mac and cheese It only hangs out in the oven for 10 minutes just long enough to get all the cheese properly melted

0.0	0.0	My my loved this we found it to be very creamy and flavorful Those who said it was bland may not have used extra sharp cheddar I also liked that it didn t need much time in the oven The only variation I made from the recipe was to use fresh garlic and onion both chopped well which I sautéed in a small amount of butter before adding the milks

0.0	0.0	Looking at the earlier reviews I guess this is either a love it or hate it recipe We LOVED IT Yes it is VERY cheesy Texture was fine I think the garlic and onion flavors do come through and will season the same way next time No it is not healthy but that was obvious from the recipe No it is not a culinary masterpiece It is extraordinary comfort food Serve it with steamed broccoli and a a salad and you don t have to feel so guilty loving that creamy rich flavor If the amount of fat bothers you save it for those cold rainy pandemic days when you need a little cheering up Or use it as a side dish to something healthier We will be making this again as a go to comfort food

0.011627906976744186	0.0	Strictly speaking this isn t Mac and cheese but rather cheese and mac 2 lbs of cheese to 1 lb of macaroni is unwarranted and unhealthy Even at 6 servings that is over 5 oz per serving For a side dish That s like putting 2 oz of butter on a 1 oz slice of bread And that s not even counting the rest of the full fat dairy in this recipe My family won t be trying this recipe Comfort food Sure but within reason	serving

0.0	0.0	It was boring as most homemade mac and cheeses are and in my opinion will be highly reliant on the cheese you use There are not enough other spices in it to add flavor so the cheese will determine your results It started out creamy but was dried up by the time it came out of the oven It actually would have been better unbaked
