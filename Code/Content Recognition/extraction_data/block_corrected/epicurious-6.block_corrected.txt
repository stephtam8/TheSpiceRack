0.0	0.0	Forget sourdough pancakes which often turn out gummy These crepes are a much better vehicle for using up discarded sourdough starter Tender and a little bit tangy they make an ideal blank canvas for sweet or savory toppings Be patient when you start to cook them since just like pancakes the first crepe is never the best If the initial ones are too pale or burnt simply adjust the heat and keep going until you reach a sweet spot

0.0	0.0	Wow This was really great I did need to add a little extra milk to make the batter thin enough and I didn t quite get all the tiny lumps out but it worked out very well nonetheless I made all the crepes at once and then I returned one at a time to the pan to add fillings and crisp the bottom of each crepe We did ham cheese mushrooms greens sausage cheese chocolate strawberries whipped cream pb chocolate and jam butter All turned out great These crepes are fantastic for both savory and sweet

0.0	0.0	These turned out fantastic I used some leftover the starter and had to add a bit extra milk to get the right consistency One suggesting for the recipe steps if you dissolve the overnight base levain in the milk first then add the remaining ingredients it should significantly reduce the lumps and the amount you need to mix

0.0	0.0	These were so so delicious I might even prefer them over regular crepes The sourdough started didn t add any tang which I don t think is necessarily a bad thing but it did make the crepe wonderfully fluffy and soft in the center with nice lacy edges I had mine with powdered sugar butter a squeeze of lemon juice and berries but other members of the family had it with homemade jam which was equally delicious
