0.0	0.0	I gave this recipe 3 forks instead of 4 because of the extensive preparation required I m an experienced cook and the prep time for this recipe was quite long Yes you can make the base ahead of time but the prepping of all the fish the day of serving requires a fair amount of time The end result is wonderful and the gremolata toasts delicious Just be aware of the time commitment

0.0	0.0	Not a fan of ham I decided to go with a Seven Fishes dinner as a nod to my husband s Italian heritage for Christmas Eve and this dish hit it out of the park The broth has such depth of flavor and the assortment of fish is just fun to eat Loved the gremolada toast something so simple but really adds a lot to the dish I would put it on anything There was no squid available in our area Colorado but I was able to Icelandic cod that is flown in daily and it was to die for Clams aren t normally my favorite but excellent with this dish I will make this an annual tradition Excellent dish

0.0	0.0	This recipe was awful There wasn t enough broth I followed the directions exactly except I omitted the squid added crab meat I do not understand how the broth was so meager I ended up adding more seafood stock but that only added more salt even though I cut back on the salt in the recipe Re read it several times but no errors that I could find I m going back to my fav Silver Palate recipe that has never failed Would have used it but didn t have the cookbook on hand Wasted effort very disappointed

0.0	0.0	At first glance this recipe as a whole seemed a bit daunting however I achieved a stunning result in the end I sautéed chorizo with the Fennel and onions as well which gave the flavour a bit of a kick Making the broth first and adding the seafood afterward so that it can all simmer together made a difference

0.0	0.0	I m not sure why some reviewers are getting their panties in a wad over whether or not this is a true cioppino recipe because I think that s beside the point Call it what you want but this is an absolutely DELICIOUS easy recipe that is a great dinner for a group of friends family or double date For the seafood we used 12 oz bag frozen langostino tails from Trader Joe s 1 2 lb cod 3 4 lb bay scallops and 16 clams Because we didn t use squid rings we omitted the step when you cook the squid for 15 20 min and let the liquid reduce by half Instead we added the wine and let that reduce a bit and then added the tomatoes stock and clam juice Also add more lemon zest to the herb butter you will absolutely not regret it This is an amazing recipe and a good way to impress your friends Will definitely be making this again

0.0	0.0	This looks like a very good recipe very close to my mother s rendition But as a third generation San Franciscan I m telling you without our beloved Dungeness crab this is just a fish stew Keep your mussels squid and whatever else you want to throw in but every S F native knows that cioppino s only reason for existing is to showcase our succulent West Coast Dungeness crab Without it you ve just got yourself a fish stew Please whatever you do get some crab and throw it in the pot

0.0	0.0	Superb flavor superb stew and even better the second day as some of its heat is tempered in the broth Cooked as written omitting the mussels I might cut back just a tad on the red pepper flakes but that s quibbling The gremolata toast points are the perfect accompaniment

0.0	0.0	Delicious We ve made this recipe a few times already It s super flavorful We have been chopping the vegetables very finely so they totally disappear in the sauce Make sure to do the gremolata toast as well it makes the dish complete One thing to be cautious of is over salting this dish the mussels and clams release salty liquid when cooking so I suggest to leave the addition of salt to the very end

0.0	0.0	Wonderful I m no chef to say the least but I made this today and it was fantastic When I say i m no chef I mean it I d rather do just about anything other than cook The only changes I made were no squid because I couldn t find any and I didn t make the toasted bread and fancy butter just plain forgot My 7 year old tried it and gave it an OK rating but she is a very picky eater so that s a good review from her My 22 year old son hat doesn t like seafood tried it and all of what he put in his bowl so again I call that a good review I love seafood and I loved it
