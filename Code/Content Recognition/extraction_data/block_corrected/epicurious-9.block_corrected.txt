0.0	0.0	Shazam it was good Made the green sauce with half mayo and half plain greek yogurt and it was really addictive My chicken came out after 50 minutes total and the breasts were juicy and tender I also made the suggested salad and would cut back on the salt a little but thought it was great Really really really loved this

0.0	0.0	One of my family s all time favorite recipes My only recommendation is to double up on the paste to baste the chicken Leftovers are fantastic You can turn it into salads tacos burritos or a river e bowl The sauce is ridiculously delish I ve seen other sites post a similar recipe I love that this one calls out fresh citrus rather than vinegar I think it makes a positive difference

0.0	0.0	The chicken and the sauce are so delicious Chicken is moist and flavorful Even better if you grill over charcoal The sauce is delicious on the chicken and on many other foods The salad is pretty good but not my favorite I recommend the Mexican Chopped Salad from this site More work but more flavor

0.0	0.0	The recipe itself gets 4 forks for flavor for sure It s really delicious and so easy to make I ve made it about 3 times now and always a hit I would take off 5 fork if I could just for the way the recipe is written particularly the bit about lemon in the chicken section Why say cut into quarters if you ll be using 2 quarters which is just half Why explain using the zested lemon for juice over the other lemon Why say squeeze 1 whole lemon and 2 quarters lemon to yield 2tbsp of juice just say 2tbsp of juice Feels over complicated I believe this part can be simplified and it trips me up every time I have to reread it several times to get it straight Otherwise great recipe

0.0	0.0	Excellent recipe I use a snug cast iron skillet to roast the chicken and baste a little more often than suggested this keeps the meat super moist and the skin does crisp up again due to the high heat I skip the salad The chicken and green sauce are divine I serve them with black beans and Peruvian garlic rice garnished with cilantro Make a simple cucumber and tomato salad to accompany this Fab every time

0.0	0.0	We made this recipe and grilled the bird My secret to grilling a spatchcocked bird is put a heavy cast iron pan on top of it like chicken under a brick but the pan gets quite hot and helps cook it from both directions Done in about half an hour on a hot grill Start nine side down for 15 minutes flip to brown skin for 5 10 minutes then flip back over til done Sauce is very good but we had to double the amount and add some chicken stock and more olive oil to get it wet and saucy Salad went great with it lime juice instead of vinegar in the dressing really makes a bright dressing nice change
