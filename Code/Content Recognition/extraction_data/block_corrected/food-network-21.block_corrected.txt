0.0	0.0	While scrambling if a thin film of egg begins to set on the edges of the pan while you are whisking away the heat is too high and you are whisking a bit too fast Be gentle and take your time If this happens very quickly before it browns incorporate those dry edges back into the eggs with a twist of the whisk and they ll disappear
