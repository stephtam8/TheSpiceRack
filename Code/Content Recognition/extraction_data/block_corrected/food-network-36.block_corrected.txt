0.0	0.0	Could classic chicken and rice be one of the most beloved comfort dinners to ever hit the plate We think so And to blow your mind even more this version is made in just one skillet Here we use bone in skin on chicken thighs which cook up in exactly the same time as the rice to guarantee juicy chicken A quick broil at the end creates the perfect crispy skin and gives a little crunch to the rice and vegetables
