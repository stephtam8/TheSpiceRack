0.0	0.0	The problem with most blueberry muffins is there are never enough blueberries But for the batter to support the weight and moisture of the berries it needs to have an airier texture than most dump and stir muffin recipes So we creamed the butter for that extra lift and to prevent the blueberries from making the batter gummy We also added buttermilk and sour cream for richness and tang and to help tenderize the crumb Lemon zest adds brightness and sprinkling raw sugar before baking give a nice crunch to the muffin tops

0.0	0.0	When measuring flour we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off excess Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour resulting in dry baked goods We developed this recipe using 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt which has larger flakes than fine table salt and is less salty If you are using fine table salt use just 1 teaspoon
