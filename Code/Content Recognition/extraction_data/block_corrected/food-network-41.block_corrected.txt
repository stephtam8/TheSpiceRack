0.0	0.0	We skipped the white sugar and went all in with dark brown sugar which gives our cookies the ideal chewiness and perfect level of sweetness Paired with the right amount of semisweet chocolate chips this treat is a definite winner The recipe makes a lot of cookies but in our opinion this is never a problem
