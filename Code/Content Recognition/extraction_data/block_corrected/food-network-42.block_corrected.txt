0.0	0.0	Perfect for breakfast lunch or dinner this traditional French quiche is filled with crispy bacon soft sweet onions and nutty Gruyere all nestled in a tender pastry crust In the shop windows of Paris you will often see quiche several inches high and brimming with filling While it is absolutely magnifique it is also incredibly time consuming and technically challenging for the home cook In our version we use a shorter tart pan so there s less fussing with large volumes of dough and a reduced amount of custard cuts the baking time in half And although you do need to refrigerate the dough twice it s worth it The pastry is extra buttery and keeping it chilled makes it easier to work with and results in a light flaky crust
