0.0	0.0	Friends have you ever tried making a nut roast before		
0.0	0.0	I was admittedly unfamiliar with this traditional vegetarian dish until my British friend Catherine served us her famous nut roast for dinner a few months ago and everyone around the table could not stop raving about how delicious it was We seriously could not get enough of this sweet savory hearty and flavor packed vegetarian roast		
0.0	0.0	My first question to Catherine of course was what sorts of delicious ingredients were hiding in her beautiful confetti ed loaf As she explained there are about a million ways to make British style nut roasts but they are traditionally made with a base of chopped nuts veggies and lots of herbs plus sort of hearty ingredient added in to give the loaf some texture such as lentils rice grains oats torn bread or various types of flour blends as well as whatever extra dried fruits or fun seasonings the cook feels like adding in The best nut roasts seem to strike the perfect balance between sweet and savory And when served with cranberry sauce a must according to Catherine and or some savory vegetarian gravy I m telling you this dish will be a showstopper with vegetarians and meat eaters alike		
0.0	0.0	The brilliance of nut roasts is that they are also easy to make ahead of time and require very little oven space So since they happen to be a traditional holiday food in the UK and so many of us were already planning to cook smaller holiday meals this year I thought that this would be the perfect week to share this recipe		
0.0	0.0	Catherine s favorite nut roast is based off of a recipe from Deliciously Ella made with lots of fresh sage rosemary mushrooms and dried apricots which my husband and I absolutely loved We ve since tinkered around with the recipe a bit and added in some lentils for extra protein as well as a generous hint of orange juice and zest which pairs deliciously with the other ingredients and tastes extra festive this time of year I ve also kept this recipe gluten free and given the option to use either traditional eggs or flax eggs as a binder if you would like to make the recipe vegan As I explain below the types of nuts seeds veggies and legumes here are also quite flexible so please feel free to tinker around with the ingredients and make this nut roast recipe your own		
0.0	0.0	Bottom line my husband and I can t believe that it took us this long to be introduced to nut roasts But we are now full on fans and look forward to making them a tradition in our house for the occasional Sunday roasts and the holiday dinners Big thanks to Catherine and some of our other British friends here in Barcelona for all of the great tips and inspiration for this recipe I really think you all are going to love it		
0.0	0.0	Nut Roast Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Before we get to the full nut roast recipe below please take a few moments to read these notes about the ingredients you will need to make this recipe Lentils I used lentils as the base for this nut roast to give it some extra moisture and protein which I recommend cooking in water or veggie stock for extra flavor until they are super soft I went with basic brown lentils but you could really use just about any type of lentils here that you have on hand Or if you re not a big fan of lentils see notes below for some other alternative ingredients you could try Veggies I used a mix of onion carrot bell pepper baby bella mushrooms and fresh spinach which you can either finely dice by hand or blitz in the food processor That said feel free to sub in whatever other veggies in the fridge sound good For example parsnips leeks sweet potato or butternut squash would all be delicious in this recipe too Garlic I used four large cloves of garlic to season the roast but feel free to add in more or less garlic if you prefer Herbs and spices I also strongly recommend adding lots of chopped fresh herbs to your nut roast as there are lots of densely packed ingredients in here that need seasoning I went with a mix of fresh sage and rosemary plus dried thyme smoked paprika fine sea salt and black pepper But feel free to use whatever fresh or dried herbs that you love best adjusting the amounts as needed to taste Orange One fresh orange zested and juiced which really brightens up the flavors and adds a festive holiday note to this nut roast Mixed nuts I honestly just cleaned out the nut and seed section of our pantry to make this nut roast so as you can see in the photos above there s a bit of everything in this one That said feel free to select any blend of nuts and seeds that you prefer You can use either salted or unsalted nuts seeds you ll just need to add less salt to season the roast in Step 5 if your nuts seeds are pre salted And if your nuts seeds are raw I recommend toasting them briefly before adding them to the recipe in order to bring out their best flavor You can either blitz the nuts seeds in the food processor seal them in a ziplock bag and crush them with a rolling pin or mallet or just chop chop chop them by hand until they reach your desired consistency Dried apricots My friend Catherine introduced us to nut roast sweetened with dried apricots which I absolutely loved and included here But feel free to use dried cranberries instead or any other dried fruit that you love best or skip the dried fruit altogether if you prefer a more savory roast Eggs Finally I used traditional eggs to bind all of the ingredients together in this roast But if you would like to make this recipe vegan flax eggs will work great too		
0.0	0.0	Tips for How To Make Nut Roast		
0.0	0.0	Full directions are included in the recipe below but here are a few key tips I ve learned about making nut roasts Finely chopped vs chunky So the texture of the ingredients in your nut roast is completely up to you you can either go with ingredients that are finely chopped or more chunky As you can see in the images above I went more of the finely chopped route which I find helps the nut roast to hold together and slice much more easily But bigger chunks are lovely too and may simply cause your nut roast to crumble a bit more when slicing Put that food processor to use if you own one If you do happen to own a food processor or some sort of chopping tool you can totally use it to save time chopping the veggies and nuts and it also does a great job with helping to pur√©e the nut roast as directed in Step 6 That said if you do not own a food processor no worries you can still easily make everything by hand Don t forget to taste and season Be sure to pause during Step 5 to take a taste of the nut roast mixture and adjust the seasonings as needed I add quite a bit of salt and pepper to this recipe plus you re welcome to add more herbs or citrus too if needed But the amount of salt will also depend on whether your nuts were pre salted so please taste and adjust the seasonings accordingly Firmly pack your ingredients It s also up to you how firmly or loosely you choose to pack the nut bake mixture into the bread pan I recommend packing the mixture in fairly tightly which helps it to hold together and slice well But if you don t want the ingredients to be too mashed together you can also opt to pack yours in a bit more loosely Sauce is essential My friend Catherine strongly believes that cranberry sauce is essential with nut roasts We also loved serving ours with my favorite mushroom gravy so feel free to go with whichever sweet or savory option you prefer Or of course a much better idea both Have fun and experiment Nut roasts recipes aren t meant to be exact so please feel free to experiment with whatever fun ingredients and amounts sound best to you and make this recipe your own The base recipe here is quite flexible and can accommodate quite a few variations see ideas below		
0.0	0.0	Possible Nut Roast Variations		
0.0	0.0	Here are a few more fun ways that you can customize this nut roast recipe if you d like Make it vegan In order to make a vegan nut roast just sub in flax eggs in place of traditional eggs They will work great Add cheese Feel free to add in up to 1 cup of shredded cheddar or gruyere cheese if you would like to make a cheesy nut roast Use different legumes rice grains or oatmeal In place of lentils feel free to substitute chickpeas white beans or any other beans that you prefer Or alternately you could sub in any type of rice quinoa farro oatmeal or other grains in place of the lentils I recommend adding in an equivalent amount of cooked rice or grains or about 1 cup of cooked oatmeal Use different veggies As mentioned above feel free to sub in any other veggies that might sound good in this recipe too such as parsnips leeks sweet potato or butternut squash Any veggies will need to be cooked until completely softened before being added to the nut roast Use different herbs spices This nut roast recipe could also be customized with any number of other fresh or dried herbs that might sound good Decorate the top I kept things simple and just pressed the confetti ed nut roast mixture into the bread pan But feel free to decorate the top of the nut roast with fun veggie or nut designs if you would like before baking Just be sure to keep a closer eye on the nut roast as it cooks so that any decor ingredients do not accidentally burn		
0.0	0.0	What To Serve With Nut Roast		
0.0	0.0	Here are some traditional sides to serve with cranberry sauce for the holidays or Sunday dinner Cranberry sauce We served this nut roast with my favorite 3 ingredient maple cranberry sauce which I highly recommend Gravy I also loved the nut roast paired with this mushroom gravy which I fully pur√©ed this time although you are welcome to leave the mushrooms chunky if you prefer Potatoes It s also very traditional to serve nut roast with some type of potatoes You could go with roasted potatoes mashed potatoes scalloped potatoes or stay tuned tomorrow for my new smashed potatoes recipe pictured below Veggies Any veggies would make for a delicious side dish here such as roasted Brussels sprouts roasted asparagus Salad If you would like a side salad I d highly recommend my everyday salad or this festive pear salad this time of year Bread I will be making my favorite 1 hour dinner rolls to serve with our nut roast for Christmas this year But some crusty no knead bread honey beer bread or rosemary focaccia would be delicious too

simmer Reduce heat to medium low to maintain the simmer cover and cook until the lentils are completely tender about 20 30 minutes Drain the lentils completely using a strainer and set aside until later Prep oven and bread pan Heat the oven to 375 F 190 C Line a 9 x 5 inch bread pan with parchment paper Saut√© the veggies and herbs Meanwhile heat the olive oil over medium high heat in a large saut√© pan Add the onion carrot and bell pepper and saut√© for 7 minutes stirring occasionally until softened Add the mushrooms and garlic and saut√© for 5 minutes stirring occasionally until the mushrooms are softened and most of the liquid in the pan has evaporated Add the spinach sage rosemary smoked paprika and thyme Saut√© for 2 minutes stirring frequently Remove pan from heat Combine all ingredients In a large mixing bowl add the cooked lentils cooked veggie mixture nuts dried apricots and orange juice and zest Toss until the mixture is evenly combined Taste and season Before we add the eggs go ahead and give the mixture a taste and season it with salt and pepper as needed The level of saltiness will vary considerably based on the type of nuts you used but you will likely need to add a generous amount of salt and pepper so don t be shy Pur√©e or mash part of the mixture If you own a food processor transfer about 1 3 of the mixture to a food processor and pulse a few times until the mixture is fairly pur√©ed Or alternately use a potato masher to mash about 1 3 of the mixture on one side of the mixing bowl until it is pur√©ed Stir the pur√©ed mixture back into the overall mixture along with the whisked eggs until everything is evenly combined Press the mixture into the pan Transfer the entire nut loaf mixture into the prepared bread pan packing it down fairly firmly which will help the loaf to slice more easily later Bake Bake uncovered for about 45 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and the loaf is cooked through I also like to remove the roast about 5 minutes before it has finished baking to brush the top of the roast with a bit of melted butter or oil to help it crisp up on top during those final few minutes in the oven but this step is totally optional Alternately if the top of the roast starts to get too browned during cooking just gently lay a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the bread pan Rest the nut roast Transfer the pan to a wire cutting rack and let the nut roast rest for about 15 20 minutes Serve Carefully lift the edges of the parchment paper up to remove the nut roast from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board Use a bread knife to slice the roast into your desired size of pieces Then serve warm with gravy or cranberry sauce and enjoy	Cook the lentils Combine the lentils with 4 cups water and 1 2 teaspoon

0.0	0.0	Chopping the veggies and nuts As mentioned in the notes above you are welcome to chop the veggies and nuts as finely or coarsely as you prefer I recommend a pretty fine chop so that the nut loaf will hold together and slice better If you happen to own a food processor it makes chopping the nuts and veggies if you would like a breeze Otherwise you can place the nuts in a ziplock bag and crush them with a rolling pin or mallet or just chop them with a knife		
0.0	0.0	Vegan flax egg alternative To make this recipe vegan feel free to whip up some flax eggs 1 tablespoon ground flax mixed with 2 5 tablespoons water per flax egg whisked together and rested for 15 minutes to thicken to use in this recipe instead They work great		
0.0	0.0	Make ahead instructions If you would like to prep this recipe in advance I recommend cooking the entire nut roast filling and refrigerating it in a sealed food storage container for up to 48 hours before baking Then transfer the filling to the prepared bake pan and bake as instructed Alternately you can go ahead and bake the nut roast let it cool completely to room temperature wrap it tightly with beeswrap or plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months Then on the day you are ready to serve the nut roast let it return to room temperature place it in a bread pan cover with foil and bake at 350 F 180 C for 15 20 minutes until warmed through
