0.0	0.0	Green Beans with Bacon Breadcrumbs Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Before we get to the full recipe below here are a few notes about the ingredients you will need to make these green beans with bacon Fresh green beans This recipe calls for fresh green beans any variety of long thin fresh green beans will work whose root ends you will need to trim off and discard before cooking I also love the look of the serving the green beans in long strands but feel free to chop your green beans into smaller bite sized pieces if you prefer Bacon Which we will finely dice and fry until crispy and then use the leftover bacon grease to sauté the breadcrumb mixture and the green beans Garlic I loved making the breadcrumb mixture quite garlicky but feel free to reduce the amount of garlic if you would prefer a less intense garlic flavor Almonds I opted to use slivered almonds but sliced or finely chopped almonds would work well too Panko breadcrumbs I recommend using Panko breadcrumbs for optimum crispiness but any breadcrumbs that you have on hand should also work You are also welcome to make your own homemade breadcrumbs or use gluten free breadcrumbs if you prefer Fresh rosemary Finally we ll use a tablespoon or so of finely chopped fresh rosemary to add an earthy herb note to the breadcrumb mixture If you don t have fresh rosemary on hand you can substitute a teaspoon or so of dried rosemary

0.0	0.0	Detailed instructions are included in the full recipe below but here s a quick overview for how to cook these green beans with bacon Fry the bacon First up we will dice the bacon and fry it in a sauté pan it s always best to start with a cold pan and then heat the bacon along with the pan until crispy Then we will set the bacon aside along with a tablespoon of grease for later and leave the remaining grease in the pan to sauté the breadcrumbs Sauté the breadcrumb mixture Next we ll sauté the garlic almonds Panko rosemary salt and pepper together until the breadcrumbs are crispy and golden brown and then combine the mixture with the cooked bacon and set it aside for later Steam sauté the green beans Using the same sauté pan just briefly wipe it down to remove any remaining breadcrumbs add the green beans along with 1 3 cup of water and a pinch of salt Cover and cook steam for about 5 minutes until the beans are nearly tender Remove the lid and continue cooking until the water has evaporated Thanks to Pam Anderson for this easy steaming method that doesn t require an extra pan Season the green beans Then toss the beans with the remaining tablespoon of bacon grease or butter and season with salt and pepper Serve You can either then toss the beans with the breadcrumb mixture in the pan or transfer the beans to a serving plate and sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture on top serve and enjoy		
0.0	0.0	Possible Recipe Variations		
0.0	0.0	If you would like to customize this green beans recipe a bit you are welcome to Roast or steam the green beans The green beans in this recipe can be cooked however you prefer If you don t love the sauté steam method you can opt to instead use roasted green beans or cook them in a steamer basket instead Use different veggies The recipe for these bacon breadcrumbs would also be awesome tossed with roasted Brussels sprouts asparagus cauliflower sweet potatoes you name it The options are pretty limitless so have fun with the recipe Use different nuts The breadcrumbs would also be delicious tossed with chopped pecans walnuts pine nuts hazelnuts pepitas or whatever other kinds of nuts might sound good Just note that the cooking time for different types of nuts may vary slightly so keep an eye on them Use different herbs Feel free to also add or sub in any other fresh herbs with the breadcrumbs that sound good to you For example fresh sage or tarragon would also be delicious Or if you don t happen to have any fresh herbs on hand you can add in a teaspoon or so of dried herbs or just omit the herbs altogether The garlicky bacon seasoning on the breadcrumbs will still be plenty flavorful Use gluten free breadcrumbs To make this recipe gluten free feel free to either use store bought gluten free breadcrumbs Or you could also just blitz some gluten free bread in a food processor and make your own
