0.0	0.0	Who s ready to warm up with a bowl of wild rice soup		
0.0	0.0	This cozy autumn wild rice soup has become one of our readers favorite recipes here on Gimme Some Oven these past few winters and is also hands down one of my personal all time faves on the blog as well It s loaded up with lots of my favorite fresh seasonal produce from sweet potatoes to kale mushrooms carrots celery and onions It s made nice and hearty with the addition of wild rice which just so happens to be lower in calories and higher in protein than many other rices But best of all it is made with the most irresistible broth seasoned with garlic and the bays as I call them and made creamy with either the addition of coconut milk cream or a roux based cream sauce		
0.0	0.0	After having originally written this recipe with the cream sauce I have to say that I as well as so many of you readers have become much more partial to the coconut version over the past few years which I think adds the perfect hint of sweetness to the broth to balance out all of those savory flavors and just so happens to make this recipe vegan too So for any of you who haven t tried that version yet or this soup in general I thought I would bump it back to the top of the blog today while we re right in the heart of cozy comfort food season I ve included instructions below for how to make either the dairy or vegan versions as well as instructions for how to make this soup in either the Instant Pot my fave Crock Pot or on the stovetop And of course if you re craving some nostalgic chicken and wild rice soup you re always welcome to toss some shredded chicken in here as well		
0.0	0.0	More than anything though I just wanted to pop in and say how happy I am that so many of you have tried and loved this soup It always means so much to me to read your comments and see photos of your dinner online So cheers to the cozy recipes that keep us all warm this time of year and now let s make some soup

0.0	0.0	Wild Rice Soup Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Before we get to the full recipe below here are a few quick notes about the ingredients you will need to make this wild rice soup recipe Wild rice I love using 100 wild rice in this recipe which is different than a wild rice blend or black rice which look out will turn your soup purple That said though you are welcome to use whatever type of rice you prefer in this soup Just note that different varieties of rice will require different cooking times Vegetable stock You could use either vegetable stock or chicken stock as the base for this soup Autumn veggies A seasonal blend of sweet potato carrots celery onion mushrooms and garlic The bays I m a big fan of using Old Bay seasoning and a bay leaf to season this soup But if you don t have Old Bay on hand I have included some alternate seasoning options below Coconut milk or cream sauce I prefer the vegan version of this soup made with coconut milk which I believe adds the perfect touch of creamy sweetness to balance out all of those savory flavors But alternately you could choose to make a cream sauce made from milk and thickened with a flour butter roux or you could just add in some half and half or heavy cream to taste Greens I love adding lots of fresh kale to this soup but baby spinach collard greens or any other soup friendly greens that you have in the crisper drawer would do Salt pepper As always for seasoning		
0.0	0.0	How To Make Wild Rice Soup		
0.0	0.0	As mentioned I have included detailed instructions below for how to make this wild rice soup recipe either in the Instant Pot pressure cooker Crock Pot slow cooker or on the stovetop But in general the method is to Cook the base of the soup Whichever cooking method you choose we will simmer the veggies and rice in the broth sans cream until the rice is completely tender Optional Make your cream sauce If you choose to use the cream sauce method you can prepare the cream sauce in a separate saucepan while the soup cooks by melting the butter whisking in the flour stirring in the milk and cooking the mixture until thickened Or you can skip this step and add in a can of coconut milk or some half and half instead Add in the coconut milk or cream sauce and kale Once the rice is ready to go stir in the coconut milk or cream sauce and kale until combined Then taste and season with salt and pepper Serve And serve it up nice and warm I love serving this soup with some crusty bread and a simple green salad Also note that the soup will continue to thicken as it cools So if it gets too thick feel free to add in extra broth and Old Bay to taste		
0.0	0.0	Possible Recipe Variations		
0.0	0.0	This recipe is quite flexible so feel free to experiment with whatever ingredient variations sound good For example you could Add chicken To make chicken and wild rice soup you can either add pre cooked diced or shredded chicken to the soup Or you can poach a raw chicken breast in the soup while the rice cooks then remove shred and add it back into the soup before serving Use a different seasoning This soup would taste delicious with a variety of different seasoning blends in place of Old Bay such as Cajun seasoning Italian seasoning or herbs de provence Make it milder Old Bay seasoning is mildly spicy so if you prefer your soup with less heat I would begin with just 2 teaspoons of Old Bay Then you can always add more to taste later if you would like Make it gluten free The vegan version of this soup is naturally gluten free But if you are making the dairy version and would like to thicken the broth a bit I would recommend adding a cornstarch slurry equal parts cold water and cornstarch mixed together to the soup until it reaches your desired consistency

0.0	0.0	Wild rice I used 100 wild rice which I love and recommend for this soup Cooking time may vary if you use a wild rice blend or a different type of rice		
0.0	0.0	Alternate cream sauce recipe In place of the coconut milk you can either add 1 1 2 cups half and half Or you can make a cream sauce by melting 3 tablespoons of butter in a separate saucepan over medium high heat whisking in 1 4 cup flour for one minute and then whisking in 1 1 2 cups milk until the mixture is smooth Let the sauce cook until it nearly reaches a simmer at which point it will thicken then remove from heat and add the sauce to the soup once the rice has completely cooked		
0.0	0.0	Slow cooking Our readers have found that the cooking time for this recipe can vary widely between different brands of slow cookers So I recommend testing the rice at the 1 hour point to see if it is close to being tender and then every 20 minutes afterwards until the rice is ready to go

0.0	0.0	Wow it is so rare for me to love a recipe as much as I love this one I m trying to eat less meat and my husband can t eat creamy soups but misses them so this was perfection I cooked with the stovetop method to avoid the cooking time variations I used ghee for sautéing the onions and used the coconut milk for the cream Perfect amount of kick from the Old Bay and love the slight crunch from the rice SO GOOD

0.0	0.0	My husband came home with home grown oyster mushrooms I made the crockpot version a few times last fall and thought this soup would be the perfect way to use the mushrooms especially since I had nearly everything in my pantry This time I made it on the stove top with brown rice and left out the kale and celery because I didn t have any It was still amazing Looking through the ingredients it seems like a strange combination but it s so good There s a little kick from the old bay that s balanced out by the creaminess of the coconut milk Even my 3 year old slurped the broth

0.0	0.0	This was delicious I always think of Old Bay as a seafood seasoning but this was wonderful I didn t have any celery so I left it out I also didn t have enough mushrooms only about 4 oz but I DID have duxelles in the freezer Duxelles are the mushroom pate that is used in beef wellington It has shallot mushrooms sherry You can freeze the extra in ice cube trays and add it to soups for depth I put about three duxelles cubes into the soup while it simmered I used a mixture of vegetable broth and chicken broth to make the six cups I used the cream of coconut to thicken I also found some shredded rotisserie chicken in the freezer and added it and the sauted mushrooms I don t like to cook mushrooms in broth they get too chewy before serving It was so good I brought several servings to work to share with my coworks for lunch this week

0.0	0.0	I followed the stovetop directions using coconut milk and ended up with the perfect consistency and really beautiful flavor Like others mentioned I never thought to use old bay in a non seafood dish but loved it Lots of punch and I only had to measure out one kind of seasoning I had some fresh thyme in the fridge and half a lemon so I threw those in there just to use them up My husband who claims to dislike mushrooms kale sweet potatoes AND wild rice are it and said it was actually really good I think I m just slowly breaking him down This will become a regular
