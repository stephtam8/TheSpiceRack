0.0	0.0	This shredded Brussels sprouts salad has been a favorite in our house lately and is bursting with so many of my favorite fresh healthy and colorful ingredients that are in season right now As you can probably spy in the photos there are lots of crisp sweet apples loaded in there that I ve paired with tangy blue cheese I ve also mixed the shredded raw Brussels with chopped baby arugula to add some peppery flavor and some softer greens to the salad Then add in the toasted nuts of your choice some thinly sliced red onions and my simple everyday salad dressing and this gorgeous simple feel good salad will be sure to make your day all the more delicious		
0.0	0.0	It s one of those salads that would be fun and festive enough to serve for holidays yet also quick and easy enough to whip up for a healthy weeknight dinner Feel free of course to use whatever type of cheese blue goat feta cheddar Parmesan nuts walnuts pecans almonds or dressing lemony or balsamic sounds best to you here And while this recipe is already naturally gluten free and vegetarian you could also easily make it vegan by using your fave plant based cheese if you d like

0.0	0.0	Brussels Sprouts Salad Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Before we get to the recipe below here are a few brief notes about the ingredients you will need to make this Brussels salad recipe Brussels sprouts Most grocery stores sell bags of pre shredded Brussels sprouts nowadays Or if you are starting out with whole Brussels sprouts here is a quick video for how to shred Brussels sprouts either by hand or with the help of a food processor Greens I love the taste of peppery baby arugula paired with the Brussels and apples in this salad But alternately you could sub in baby spinach chopped kale or any other salad greens that you prefer Or you could just opt to use 100 Brussels sprouts as your greens instead Apples Feel free to use whatever type of apples you love best for this salad I just recommend choosing a variety that is nice and crisp to give the salad some extra crunch Nuts As you can see I opted for toasted walnuts for this salad But pecans almonds pistachios or pepitas would all be delicious options here too Red onion I love the crunch and sweet sharp taste of thinly sliced red onions in this salad But if you are a bit more onion averse feel free to give the sliced onions a quick rinse with water before adding them to the salad to mellow the flavor a bit Or you can leave the onions out entirely if you prefer Blue cheese Forever and always my favorite cheese to add to any sort of apple salad But if blue cheese isn t your thing feel free to use crumbled goat cheese feta cheese shaved Parmesan or even an aged sharp cheddar instead Dressing Finally I used my all purpose everyday salad dressing for this recipe made easily with olive oil lemon juice Dijon garlic salt and pepper which was lovely It would also be delicious if you swapped balsamic or red wine vinegar for the lemon juice if you prefer more of a vinaigrette

0.0	0.0	This recipe is quite flexible so please feel free to tinker around with any of the ingredient swaps mentioned above or you are welcome to Use different fruit Fresh pears and or pomegranate arils would also be a delicious swaps for the fresh apples in this recipe Or you could also opt to add some dried apples cranberries cherries in the salad too Use candied walnuts My recipe for candied walnuts or pecans would also be an awesome option here if you have the extra time to prep the walnuts Add bacon If you feel like adding in a bit of protein some salty smoky bacon would awesome in this salad too

0.0	0.0	A little tip I cut up apples for salad on Sunday night and use on salads all week the secret is tossing storing them in lemon juice I assemble the salads the night before and the apples are never brown at lunch the next day or at the end of the week

0.0	0.0	I enjoyed this salad and ate it for my dinner two nights in a row I was out of blue cheese but had feta so used that instead The first night I made it as written except for the substitution of feta for blue and then added some chopped bacon The second night I added a dash of maple syrup to the dressing and tossed some dried cranberries into the salad I thought it took the salad up a notch This could easily be dressed up with cooked chicken or turkey added for a main dish salad I would agree that the greens could be just about anyone you have on hand and will work well The nice thing about this salad is it is easy to personalize it It would be good with other cheeses other fruits dates or figs in addition to or instead of apples
