0.0	0.0	Friends do you have a go to homemade salad dressing recipe that you love		
0.0	0.0	If not bookmark mine		
0.0	0.0	I ve been in the habit of making my own salad dressings for years partly because I prefer to avoid the additives found in many store bought salad dressings but mostly because delicious salad dressing is super quick and easy to make from scratch and it always tastes extra fresh and flavorful		
0.0	0.0	We fondly call this particular recipe my everyday salad dressing in our house because we quite literally make some version of it nearly every day of the week Yes we eat a lo t of salads in our casa It s a basic recipe made simply with olive oil lemon juice or vinegar garlic Dijon salt and pepper that can be whipped up in just 5 minutes And I m telling you this salad dressing somehow magically works with just about any type of salad you might be craving		
0.0	0.0	It s also an incredibly versatile base recipe that can be easily tweaked and customized if you would like to play around with using different types of vinegar mustards added herbs or added sweeteners too Leftovers also keep well in the fridge if you would like to make a larger batch to stretch out over the course of a week Which I find to be excellent motivation to eat more salad it s always easier to toss one together when you have some delicious dressing ready to go And this salad dressing recipe just so happens to be naturally gluten free vegetarian and vegan too		
0.0	0.0	Anyway I first introduced this dressing a few years ago when I shared our favorite everyday side salad recipe and many of you have shared since that it has become a regular staple in your homes as well So for anyone who may have missed that other post or would just like a stellar salad dressing recipe to bookmark I promise this one won t let you down Let s make a quick batch		
0.0	0.0	Everyday Salad Dressing Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Before we get to the full recipe below here are a few quick notes about the salad dressing ingredients you will need for this recipe Olive oil It s important to use good quality olive oil for salad dressings because its flavor is quite prominent in the dressing I always recommend shopping for olive oil that is certified extra virgin and really love this brand for salad dressings Garlic I prefer to press or mince a small clove of fresh garlic for this salad dressing But if you re in a hurry a 1 2 teaspoon of garlic powder will work too Lemon juice or vinegar Most of the time we make this recipe in our house with freshly squeezed lemon juice which I find is super versatile and works with nearly any kind of salad But if you prefer to turn this recipe into a vinaigrette you can opt instead to use any type of vinegar that you choose I would recommend red wine vinegar as the most versatile option but balsamic sherry white wine apple cider or other types of vinegars would work too Dijon mustard I also almost always add a teaspoon of creamy Dijon mustard to my salad dressings If you don t love mustard don t worry its flavor is not overpowering and really just serves to round out all of the other flavors But that said if you would like a more mustard y dressing feel free to double or triple the amount of Dijon Or if you prefer a grainy mustard whole grain Dijon will work great too Fine sea salt To bring out all of those delicious flavors Black pepper And however much freshly cracked black pepper you prefer I often double or triple the amount in the recipe as we love lots of black pepper in our house		
0.0	0.0	How To Make Salad Dressing		
0.0	0.0	Easy All you really need to do to make this salad dressing recipe is stir or shake all of the ingredients together until combined You can either accomplish this In a bowl or measuring cup Combine all of the ingredients and whisk until combined In a mason jar Combine all ingredients cover with a lid and shake vigorously until combined In a blender Combine all ingredients and pulse until combined This method is especially nice if you are making a larger batch plus you do not need to press or mince the garlic cloves		
0.0	0.0	Possible Recipe Variations		
0.0	0.0	This basic salad dressing recipe is incredibly versatile so please feel free to play around with different ingredients and customize whatever dressing will best suit your salad For example you could Use a different kind of vinegar As mentioned above feel free to substitute any type of vinegar that you would like in place of the olive oil such as red wine vinegar white wine vinegar balsamic vinegar sherry vinegar apple cider vinegar champagne vinegar etc Use a different kind of mustard or add more You can also opt for a grainy Dijon mustard instead of creamy Dijon if you prefer And if you would like this recipe to taste even more mustard y just increase the amount of mustard to taste Add a sweetener If you would like a sweeter dressing just add in a teaspoon or two of your desired sweetener I recommend either honey or maple syrup Add herbs You can also add in any dried or fresh herbs you would like too Add crushed red pepper flakes If you would like to give this dressing some subtle heat feel free to add in a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes as well I especially love this when using this dressing for an Italian salad

0.0	0.0	Acid options This salad dressing recipe also works wonderfully with just about any kind of vinegar red wine vinegar white wine vinegar balsamic vinegar apple cider vinegar sherry vinegar etc So feel free to use whatever will work best for your salad		
0.0	0.0	Sweetener options Feel free to add in 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey or your desired sweetener if you would like to make this dressing a bit sweeter		
0.0	0.0	Storage instructions I find that the lemon juice version of this dressing doesn t taste so great after more than 24 hours in the fridge So if you would like to make a larger batch of the dressing to store for up to 1 week I recommend using vinegar in place of the lemon juice
