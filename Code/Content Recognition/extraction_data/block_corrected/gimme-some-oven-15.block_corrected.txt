0.0	0.0	Before we get to the full recipe below here are a few quite notes about the ingredients you will need to make these pumpkin cupcakes Dry ingredients A basic combination of all purpose flour baking powder and baking soda Spices I seasoned these with pumpkin pie spice you can use homemade or store bought ground cinnamon and fine sea salt Pumpkin purée I used canned pumpkin purée for these cupcakes but feel free to use homemade pumpkin purée if you prefer Just be sure not to accidentally purchase canned pumpkin pie filling which is a different product altogether Oil I tested this recipe with butter and oil and prefer the lighter texture that comes with oil You could use canola oil vegetable oil or any neutral flavored oil that you prefer Sugars I used half granulated white sugar and half light brown sugar Vanilla Just a teaspoon or so to complement all of those delicious pumpkin spice flavors Eggs To bind the batter together Cream cheese frosting I just used my standard cream cheese frosting recipe here made with room temperature cream cheese butter powdered sugar vanilla extract and a pinch of salt

0.0	0.0	Want to customize this pumpkin cupcake recipe a bit Feel free to Add nuts Stir 1 4 cup of chopped pecans or walnuts into the batter if you would like Or you can sprinkle them on top of the cream cheese frosting Add chocolate chips Stir 1 4 cup semisweet chocolate chips into the batter if you would like Or you can sprinkle them on top of the cream cheese frosting Use applesauce If you would like to lighten up the cupcakes feel free to use 1 4 cup applesauce and 1 4 cup oil instead of 1 2 cup oil Add cinnamon to the frosting Mix 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon or more less to taste into the frosting instead of sprinkling a pinch on top

0.0	0.0	Sifting the powdered sugar If you would like your frosting to be free of powdered sugar clumps I recommend sifting the powdered sugar before you add it to the mixing bowl Or if you use an electric mixer either a stand mixer or an electric hand mixer that will also make it easier to reduce the clumps
