0.0	0.0	Memories have been popping up on my phone the past few weeks from our trip to Provence France a year ago when my husband s and my parents all came over to Europe to visit us And seeing photos of all of those beautiful countrysides narrow cobblestoned streets charming cottages and dreamy local markets overflowing with fresh flowers produce breads cheeses and wines has me feeling some major wanderlust again I m so so ready for the time to come when we can all safely travel again		
0.0	0.0	Sigh I know it s still going to be awhile So in the meantime at least Barclay and I have been re living some of our favorite past adventures and dreaming about future trips to come through our meals And I have to say that this cozy French Lentil and Mushroom Soup recipe had us feeling all of those Provencal fall vibes again in the most delicious of ways		
0.0	0.0	This lovely soup was inspired by our trips to the outdoor markets around Aix en Provence where local mushrooms leeks greens and herbs were all proudly in season this time of year When simmered together with those beautiful marbled French lentils my favorite type of lentils to use in soup and finished with a splash of balsamic they combine to make a simple yet wonderfully satisfying meal that we have been enjoying on repeat lately I intentionally wrote the recipe here to make a fairly large batch since the leftovers keep beautifully for easy lunches and dinners later in the week And the recipe itself also happens to be naturally gluten free vegan and packed with good for you protein making it the perfect healthier counterpoint to some of the more indulgent comfort foods we ve been enjoying this time of year

0.0	0.0	French Lentil and Mushroom Soup Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Before we get to the recipe below here is a quick overview of the ingredients that you will need to make this French lentil and mushroom soup recipe Leeks Leeks always remind me of our time in France and taste so lovely in this soup If you are new to working with leeks here is a quick video tutorial for how to select cut and clean leeks It s quite easy Or if you don t have a chance to pick up leeks at the store you could alternately just dice one large yellow onion and add it to the soup instead Celery Which we will thinly slice and sauté along with the leeks Mushrooms I recommend adding lots of mushrooms to this soup like at least 1 pound Or if you really love mushrooms you could add even more I opted for baby bella mushrooms also called creminis but white button mushrooms shiitakes wild mushrooms or a mix of any different varieties of mushrooms would work here Garlic Because the seasonings for this soup are so simple I recommend going big on the garlic here I used five large garlic cloves but feel free to use more or less to taste White wine I used a very generous pour of dry white wine to deglaze the pan which also adds some rich flavor to the broth You could also use dry red wine instead Or if you prefer not to cook with alcohol just add in some extra stock plus maybe a bit more balsamic Veggie stock Either veggie stock or chicken stock will do here And again since the seasonings are so simple for this soup I recommend purchasing some good quality stock French lentils or lentils de Puy Fun fact these are the same variety of lentils but French lentils are technically grown in North America while lentils de Puy are grown in France Whichever you choose I love using these marbled lentils in this soup because they have a deliciously earthy and peppery flavor they hold their shape when cooked and retain a nice firm texture in this soup That said if you can t get your hands on French lentils you could easily substitute brown or green lentils instead Herbs I kept things simple by just adding lots of fresh thyme and bay leaves to season this soup along with salt and black pepper But the herbs in this soup are quite flexible Rosemary tarragon and or herbs de Provence would all taste delicious too Greens I happened to have baby spinach in the fridge so added a few large handfuls to wilt down into the soup just before serving But chopped fresh kale or collard greens would be delicious options too I also sprinkled some microgreens on top of the bowls before serving which looked lovely Balsamic vinegar And finally I highly recommend adding a drizzle of balsamic vinegar to the soup just before serving for a final burst of flavor A tip I learned from Bon Appetit merci You can either add the balsamic to the large stockpot or drizzle some over each individual bowl of soup just before serving Delicious		
0.0	0.0	Possible Recipe Variations		
0.0	0.0	This simple French lentil and mushroom soup recipe is quite flexible so feel free to customize the ingredients here however you might like For example you could Add bacon or pancetta If I wasn t making this soup vegetarian I would have definitely added some diced bacon or pancetta and sautéed the veggies in its leftover grease to add some extra flavor and protein to this soup It would be delicious Add tomatoes or tomato paste Feel free to also add in a can of diced tomatoes or a tablespoon or two of tomato paste to add some tomato flavor to this lentil soup Add potatoes You could also add in some diced potatoes to make this a bit more hearty Add cheese If you happen to have a block of Parmesan on hand some freshly crated cheese would taste delicious sprinkled on top of each serving Purée the soup Feel free to also use an immersion blender or you could transfer the soup in small batches to a traditional blender to purée part or all of this recipe to make the broth a bit thicker Omit the wine If you prefer not to cook with alcohol just add in a bit of extra stock plus an extra small drizzle of balsamic vinegar

0.0	0.0	Prepping the leeks Leeks can often have dirt hiding between their inner layers So I recommend first trimming off and discarding the dark green parts and the ends of each leek Then carefully slice the leeks in half lengthwise slice each half into lots of thin half moons transfer the chopped leeks to a strainer and rinse with cold water while tossing the leeks with your fingers to uncover any dirt and drain		
0.0	0.0	Herb options I recommend adding in lots and lots of fresh thyme to this recipe But you could use a few teaspoons add to taste of dried thyme instead if that s what you have on hand Or rosemary tarragon and or herbs de Provence seasoning would be delicious in this recipe too		
0.0	0.0	A note about broth This soup will continue to soak up more broth the longer that it sits in a hot pot So if needed feel free to add in some extra stock and seasonings to increase the amount of broth		
0.0	0.0	Storage instructions Leftover soup can be cooled to room temperature and then transferred to food storage containers then either stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months

0.0	0.0	Ok so I had some mushrooms that needed to be used ASAP and I didn t have French lentils or leeks or greens so I used brown lentils and a regular onion to make a half batch I know that is far from the recipe but leads me to the most important question WHY HAVE I NEVER FINISHED SOUP WITH BALSAMIC BEFORE That made my very stripped down version of this soup totally amazing I can t wait to do something similar again
