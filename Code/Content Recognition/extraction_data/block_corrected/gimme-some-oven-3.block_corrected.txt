0.0	0.0	It s the Year of the Linzer Cookies here in our casa		
0.0	0.0	Each holiday season there always tends to be one cookie recipe that ends up being the new fave that we can t stop baking And this year my husband and I are officially obsessed with these classic lovely buttery jam filled little delights		
0.0	0.0	Linzer cookies originally hail from Austria where they are said to have become popular hundreds of years ago basically as a mini version of their famous Linzer torte They traditionally feature a sandwich of simple buttery shortbread cookies made with almond flour which are then filled with a colorful window of raspberry jam poking through		
0.0	0.0	Nowadays you can find variations on Linzer cookies all around the world made with all different kinds of nut flours or nut free different types of fillings jams lemon curd Nutella you name it or cut out into all sorts of different shapes and sizes I ve included lots of cute cookie cutter recommendations for you below So there are lots of fun ways to get creative with these cookies Here in our house we re definitely partial to the more traditional style Linzer cookies made with almond flour and especially love mixing a generous amount of orange or lemon zest into the dough as well You re also welcome to add in some ground cinnamon if you d like I also love that the shortbread recipe here is not overly sweet so the cookies balance the jam quite nicely and really let its fruity flavor shine through Plus they always look so fun and festive this time of year		
0.0	0.0	Anyway I know that there are probably already a million Linzer cookie recipes out there on the internet But after baking oh nearly a dozen batches of the cookies already this season like I said we re a bit obsessed my husband and I have decided that this is the Linzer cookie recipe we officially love best So today I wanted to pop in and share it with you too		
0.0	0.0	Linzer Cookie Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Before we get to the full Linzer cookie recipe below here are a few important notes about the ingredients you will need to make them Flour I tested both a traditional all purpose flour and a gluten free all purpose flour blend for this recipe and both worked beautifully Almond flour As I mentioned above we also love using traditional almond flour in the shortbread cookies which you can either buy pre ground or you can purchase about 120 grams of blanched almonds and then toast and ground them yourself Butter You will just need unsalted butter that is room temperature so that it will mix well with the sugar Salt I also used 3 4 teaspoon fine sea salt in this recipe But if you only have iodized table salt on hand you will only need to use 1 2 teaspoon White sugar I made these cookies with traditional white granulated sugar but feel free to experiment with any other sweeteners that you prefer Vanilla extract I also love a generous amount of vanilla extract in the shortbread Egg To bind all of the shortbread ingredients together Lemon or orange I would say that citrus zest is optional for this recipe but honestly it adds so much that I really believe it s essential We re partial to making the shortbread with orange zest but lemon is more traditional and also quite lovely Ground cinnamon almond extract These are both optional add ins that you can mix into the dough if you would like I m personally not a huge fan of cinnamon in this dough but really love the almond extract Powdered sugar For dusting the tops of the cookies Jam For filling the cookie sandwiches We re quite partial to Bonne Maman jams in our house they are absolutely everywhere here in Europe but any favorite brand flavor of jam that you love will do		
0.0	0.0	Linzer Cookie Cutters		
0.0	0.0	So you can totally make Linzer cookies with any type of cookie cutter or biscuit cutter that you d like If you d like to make things easy there are pre made Linzer cookie cutter sets you can purchase that have interchangeable shapes for the smaller windows inside Or alternately you can just use any sort of round or larger cookie biscuit cutters ideas below plus a mini cookie cutter that you already own Here are a few suggestions Linzer cookie cutter sets I used this set for the heart cookies pictured just below which yields small 2 inch round cookies with traditional window shapes I also love these small 2 inch cookie sets which you can purchase with either traditional Christmas Halloween winter or springtime window themes Themed cookie cutter sets You could also use a nesting set of cookie cutters in the same shape such as these sets for snowflakes hearts stars gingerbread people etc Round cookie cutters You could select the size you d like from a straight edged round cookie cutter set or a biscuit cutter set or a scalloped round cookie cutter set or biscuit cutter set Mini cookie cutters There are lots of fun mini cookie cutter sets online such as these mini assorted alphabet Christmas or dogs cookie cutter sets I just recommend double checking the size of any mini sets that you order online to be sure that they will fit inside your larger outer cookie cutter as sizes for mini cutters seem to vary considerably		
0.0	0.0	How To Make Linzer Cookies		
0.0	0.0	Detailed instructions for how to make Linzer cookies are included in the recipe below but here is a quick overview of the process Make the shortbread dough Prep the dough as directed Chill the dough Shape the dough into disks wrap tightly in beeswrap or plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 30 60 minutes until chilled Roll out the dough Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it is uniformly about 1 4 inch thick Then use your preferred cookie cutters to cut out the dough 50 shapes that are solid 50 shapes with windows cut out in the center I also like to bake the little window cut outs too Bake Transfer the cookies to a parchment covered sheet and bake until lightly golden keeping a close eye on the cookies as different shapes sizes may cook more less quickly Remove from the oven and transfer cookies to a wire baking rack to cool Assemble the cookies Then the fun part Dust the window cookies with powdered sugar Spread a dollop of jam on the other cookies and gently place a window cookies on top to form cute little Linzer cookie sandwiches And enjoy		
0.0	0.0	Possible Variations		
0.0	0.0	Here are a few more ideas for how to customize this Linzer cookies recipe if you d like Make them gluten free As mentioned above this recipe would also work with a gluten free all purpose flour blend if you would like to make gluten free Linzer cookies Make your own DIY almond flour Simply measure out around 120 grams of unblanched almonds and ground them in a food processor or coffee grinder to make almond flour I also recommend lightly toasting the almonds in the oven before grinding them for better flavor Use a different kind of nut flour Instead of almond flour you could alternately toast around 120 grams of raw pecans or walnuts and ground them in a food processor or coffee grinder to make pecan or walnut flour I also recommend lightly toasting the nuts in the oven before grinding them for better flavor Use a different filling In place of jam you could fill the Linzer cookies with lemon curd or any type of citrus curd Nutella or any other fillings that sound fun
