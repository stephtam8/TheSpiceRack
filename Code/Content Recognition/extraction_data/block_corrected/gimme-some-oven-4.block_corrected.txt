0.0	0.0	By contrast to traditional potato leek soup recipes which are usually puréed and loaded up with tons of heavy cream this more rustic version is left deliciously nice and chunky which I love It s also made with a light herby garlicky broth that tastes wonderfully flavorful on its own without any need for cream And when served with zesty homemade croutons or a good loaf of crusty bread I m telling you this soup is the most wonderful wintertime comfort food		
0.0	0.0	I ve been making various versions of this soup ever since we moved to Europe since leeks absolutely abound here Truly they re so popular that even the tiniest little convenience stores always carry them But it always seemed like such a basic simple recipe that I never really considered posting it here until my husband insisted this winter that our friends and family back home would love it just as much as we do		
0.0	0.0	As you ll see the ingredient list is short and simple and can be customized with whatever fresh or dried herbs you happen to have on hand It s also naturally gluten free vegetarian and vegan Although if you happen to eat dairy we always love topping our bowls with some coarsely grated Parmesan cheese And best of all it can be ready to go in just a half hour or so making it a great recipe for busy weeknights We usually serve ours with a simple side salad and some crusty bread or croutons and the combo always feels perfectly light and cozy

0.0	0.0	Before we get to the full recipe below here are a few notes about the ingredients you will need to make this rustic potato leek soup recipe Leeks If you are new to working with leeks check out my short guide including a video tutorial for how to select clean and cut leeks We will only use the white and light green parts in this soup so be sure to discard the dark green parts And as always don t forget to clean your leeks since dirt often gets trapped between those layers Potatoes I prefer to use unpeeled buttery Yukon Gold potatoes for this soup but feel free to use any type of potato that you prefer Onions celery and garlic These will serve as the other base veggies for our soup sautéed in olive oil or butter I love adding in lots of garlic but you can use less if you prefer Dry white wine To deglaze the pan and add some depth of flavor to the broth That said if you prefer not to cook with alcohol you can just add in a bit of extra veggie stock Vegetable stock To serve as the base for our broth Or chicken stock would work too Fresh thyme I recommend adding in lots of fresh thyme and or any other fresh French inspired herbs that you love such as rosemary sage tarragon oregano etc If you don t have fresh herbs on hand you could add in a teaspoon or two of dried thyme add it slowly to taste or even better a few teaspoons of Herbs de Provence or Italian Seasoning Bay leaves I also recommend adding a few bay leaves to the broth Cayenne salt and black pepper And as mentioned above I really love adding some cayenne to the broth to give it a noticeable but subtle backing of heat I usually add 1 4 teaspoon which you can definitely notice But if you re wary of heat I recommend starting with just a pinch and you can then add more if you d like Optional toppings We love serving this soup with homemade croutons we re partial to sourdough croutons made with a sprinkling of Herbs de Provence and a sprinkle of coarsely grated Parmesan cheese But feel free to also add some chopped fresh chives or other herbs on top if you d like too

0.0	0.0	Detailed instructions are included in the recipe below But here is a quick overview of how to make potato leek soup Sauté the veggies First we ll sauté the onion leeks celery and garlic in a large pot until softened and then deglaze the pan with some dry white wine Add the potatoes and broth Next come the potatoes vegetable stock thyme bay leaves and cayenne Simmer Let the soup all simmer together until the potatoes have softened The amount of time will depend on how chunky your potatoes are Season Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme stems Give the soup a taste and season with however much salt and black pepper you think it needs This will also depend on how salty your veggie stock happens to be Serve Serve warm garnished with whatever toppings sound good and enjoy		
0.0	0.0	Possible Recipe Variations		
0.0	0.0	As I mentioned above this potato leek soup recipe is incredibly flexible So please feel free to experiment and customize it however you d like For example you could Add extra veggies greens Feel free to also add in any other simple soup veggies or greens that you love such as carrots parsnips spinach or kale Add a protein This soup would also be delicious with some ham chicken or sausage added in Or of course crispy bacon would also be delicious sprinkled on top Add pepperoncini We ve also made this soup with sliced pepperoncini peppers in place of the cayenne and they add a delicious briny hint of heat Highly recommend Add cream If you would like a creamier soup feel free to add in your desired amount of heavy cream Purée the soup If you prefer the texture of puréed potato leek soup just use an immersion blender to purée the soup once the potatoes are completely tender and you have discarded the bay leaves and thyme until smooth Or alternately you could transfer it in batches to a traditional blender and pulse until smooth Just use caution as always when puréeing hot liquids I recommend only filling the blender halfway and always tenting open the cap on the blender lid so that hot air can escape

0.0	0.0	Enjoyed making this soup Love how it s laid out with different options along the way as well as explanations such as how to wash the leeks An easy recipe especially considering the alternative options I think I would possibly try pureeing another time to see how that effects the flavors coming together Both my husband and I felt it needed hot sauce but then again we put hot sauce on a lot of dishes 4 stars versus 5 is mainly just because it was a little bland But truly enjoyed how this is presented from start to finish Will definitely use this recipe again Thank you
