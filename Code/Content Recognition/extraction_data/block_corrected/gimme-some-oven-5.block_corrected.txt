0.0	0.0	Before we get to the full recipe below here are a few notes about the ingredients you ll need to make this coconut curry Onion Our curry begins with onion white yellow or red sautéed in olive oil until softened Ginger and garlic I highly recommend using fresh ginger and garlic for maximum flavor in this curry which we will mince or you can grate the ginger and add to the sauté That said if you don t have fresh ginger in the house you can substitute 1 teaspoon of ground ginger in place of the fresh ginger Spices I kept things simple for this curry with a combination of garam masala and curry powder plus salt and pepper Milks To make this curry nice and creamy we will use a blend of full fat coconut milk I like this brand and some type of plain plant based milk I used oat milk Alternately you could also just add in some veggie stock in place of the plain plant based milk Tomatoes One can of diced tomatoes I recommend fire roasted diced tomatoes if they are available in your grocery store for extra flavor Sweet potato One large sweet potato diced into 1 2 inch cubes Chickpeas One can of chickpeas rinsed and drained Greens I added a few handfuls of fresh baby spinach to this curry but feel free to use kale collards or any other greens that you prefer Lemon juice A generous squeeze of lemon juice or you could also use lime juice really helps to brighten up the flavors of the broth Toppings Finally I recommend loading each bowl of curry up with lots of chopped fresh cilantro a sprinkling of thinly sliced green onions and or a pinch of crushed red chili flakes if you would like to add some heat Feel free to serve your curry with naan bread rice and or rice noodles

0.0	0.0	Ali December 7 2020 1 55 pm		
0.0	0.0	Coconut milk You are welcome to use low fat coconut milk if you prefer Or you can also sub in almond or oat milk although the curry will be much less creamy and considerably thinner

0.0	0.0	Oh my goodness Beyond delicious Also I got some light colored sweet potatoes in my CSA that were so dry and hard you almost couldn t eat them They did great in this recipe and the sauce was the perfect thing I only had light coconut milk but I had some half n half so subbed about a half cup of that for the oat milk We even forgot the toppings did not need them

0.0	0.0	Such a rich meld of flavors in this dish I made this recipe as is served over basmati rice although I may have added a bit more ginger than the recipe called for and took the suggestion to add cilantro as a topping My husband is not a big fan of curry but he loved it This recipe is a keeper thanks for sharing it

0.0	0.0	YUMMY I made this today while on a work ZOOM video off and so quick easy and flavorful I used two sweet potatoes just because I had two and the extra doesn t hurt I didn t have any garam masala so I used equal parts cumin and allspice as a substitute I also used regular milk as well as an already opened can of evaporated milk plus coconut Used rotel which is tomatoes with chiles since all I had on hand and added 1 lb of shrimp that I seasoned prior to The flavor is amazing and the dish is so creamy I added no salt and pepper once done didn t need it I added spinach and lemon as instructed and served over rice I know it will taste even better tomorrow once the flavors meld Word to the wise do not skip adding cilantro it s a MUST Your recipes never fail

0.0	0.0	I m new to cooking Indian food but love all the ingredients in this recipe I followed this recipe as much as I could I used whole milk instead of oat and I couldn t find garam masala I also threw in chicken We served it over rice OUTSTANDING flavors and textures I m not familiar with Garam masala so I don t know how it would change the flavor but I m so happy with the way this came out My family loves it and it will be a recipe I will definitely be making again Thank you for sharing

0.0	0.0	This recipe was so wonderful until the last step when I added the lemon juice Perhaps my lemons are larger than the ones you use The curry became a sour disaster and very disappointing since it was so delicious before I would make this again and just skip the lemon juice or add very slowly and taste after each bit

0.0	0.0	This was fantastic I made some changes based on what I had in the house no spinach but added frozen peas no coconut milk used half half no gram marsala used cumin and allspice and I did add some sauteed chicken breast and served it with jasmine rice It was easy and forgiving Will definitely make it again and now I know it can easily be scaled up for a larger group when my kids visit Thank you
