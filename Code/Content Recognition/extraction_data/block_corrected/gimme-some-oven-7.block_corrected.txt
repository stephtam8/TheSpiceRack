0.0	0.0	After five years together I just recently learned that my husband is pro chocolate chips in his oatmeal cookies and lol apparently strongly opposed to raisins Whereas I am the exact opposite and consider oatmeal and raisins the perfect match made in cookie heaven and would rather just make classic chocolate chip cookies if I m craving chocolate Growing up my mom was always a fan of adding butterscotch chips to hers My best friend loves oatmeal cookies made with a generous sprinkling of nuts while her husband prefers his cookies plain And my 11 year old next door neighbor recently told me he has concluded that M Ms in cookies are without a doubt the coolest

0.0	0.0	Oatmeal Cookie Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	First a few notes about the oatmeal cookie ingredients that you will need to make this recipe Butter I used unsalted butter but if you only have salted on hand just decrease the amount of salt in the recipe by 1 4 teaspoon Light brown sugar This recipe is sweetened with light brown sugar which needs to be firmly packed into the measuring cup when you are measuring it out Egg To bind all of our ingredients together Vanilla extract Be sure to use pure vanilla extract for optimum flavor Oats This recipe calls for old fashioned oats also known as rolled oats which will make the cookies nice and chewy Flour I ve only tested this recipe with all purpose flour but it may work with some alternate kinds of flour as well Cinnamon I love my oatmeal cookies nice and cinnamon y but feel free to add in any other warming spices that you like as well Sea salt I prefer to use fine sea salt in my cooking But if you only have iodized table salt on hand just note that you will need to use slightly less since its flavor is stronger I also like to sprinkle the cookies with a pinch of flaky sea salt after they have baked Baking soda To help our cookies rise Optional add ins Feel free to add in some raisins or dried cranberries or other chopped dried fruit baking chips chocolate chips butterscotch chips toffee chips etc and or chopped nuts pecans walnuts etc too if you would like		
0.0	0.0	Tips For How To Make Oatmeal Cookies		
0.0	0.0	Full recipe is included below but here are a few tips for how to make the best oatmeal cookies Use old fashioned oats Double check that you didn t accidentally buy quick oats or instant oats Old fashioned oats also known as rolled oats will give these a better chewier texture and cook in the correct amount of time Start with room temperature butter In order for the butter to properly cream with the sugars it s important that your butter be room temperature not melted not hard and cold when starting the recipe Correctly measure the flour If you are measuring flour by volume with a measuring cup instead of a scale avoid scooping the measuring cup directly into the bag of flour to measure it since this tends to pack in excess flour Instead fluff the flour in the bag briefly with a fork then lightly spoon it into your measuring cup and level it out with a knife Chill the dough In order for these cookies not to flatten too much in the oven it helps to refrigerate the dough until it is chilled You can either refrigerate the entire batch of dough and wait an hour or two until is it chilled Or for a speedier method you can go ahead and roll out however many dough balls you would like to bake and refrigerate them on the parchment covered baking sheet for about 15 20 minutes until they are chilled Customize your add ins however you d like Everyone has their own opinion about exactly what should go in an oatmeal cookie So see options below for fun ways that you can customize yours exactly as you d like
