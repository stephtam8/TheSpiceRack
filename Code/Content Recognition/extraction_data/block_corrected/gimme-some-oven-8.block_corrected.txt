0.0	0.0	This was great I added a cinnamon stick and a dash of nutmeg and stirred the orange juice and zest in at the end instead of letting it simmer with the cranberries So good maple syrup is a great way to sweeten this

0.0	0.0	hi your thoughts on subbing lemon instead of using orange i m also doing apple juice instead of water thanks

0.0	0.0	Love the apple juice idea The lemon will definitely add a bit of extra tartness so I would start with just a tablespoon of two of the lemon juice and then you can add more later if you d like
