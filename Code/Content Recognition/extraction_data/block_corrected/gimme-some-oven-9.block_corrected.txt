0.0	0.0	To all of my fellow apple pie lovers out there have you ever tried making apple pandowdy		
0.0	0.0	I first heard about this old fashioned dish which is said to have originated in the Pennsylvania Dutch tradition years ago from Martha Stewart And I was immediately intrigued because it was basically everything I love about apple pie without all of the work of having to assemble a pie		
0.0	0.0	Details about the exact heritage of this dish seem to be a little fuzzy But traditionally apple pandowdy is usually made a baking dish or cast iron skillet with bite sized pieces of pie dough sprinkled on top of a cozy cinnamon apple filling Everything bakes up together in the oven to toasty bubbly sweet perfection Then immediately after pulling the dish out of the oven you take a spoon and press the topping down gently into the filling so that it can soak up some of those hot apple juices And finally serve the apple pandowdy nice and warm with a generous scoop of cold vanilla ice cream		
0.0	0.0	It s all exactly as delicious as you would imagine And so much quicker and easier to make than apple pie So since I figure we could all use some easy shortcuts for our lower key holiday season this year this seemed like the perfect time to bring this old fashioned dish back to the future		
0.0	0.0	I have loved making this dessert with homemade or store bought pie crust over the years But I actually recently saw a fun version from Bon Appetit that used fluffy puff pastry as an apple pandowdy topping and after trying it out a few times my husband and I have agreed that we like it even more than the original Granted I have made a few tweaks to BA s recipe to make it a bit quicker and easier And I ve also been on a big vanilla chai kick this winter so I ve added a few extra chai inspired spices to the apple filling to make it extra special too		
0.0	0.0	So for anyone else who might be interested in an apple pie ish recipe this holiday season that requires a bit less work here s the pandowdy version that we have been loving lately I think you re going to love it too		
0.0	0.0	Apple Pandowdy Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	Before we get to the full recipe below here are a few notes about the ingredients you will need to make this apple pandowdy Store bought puff pastry One package of store bought frozen puff pastry which we will let thaw on the countertop while the apple filling is prepared so that it becomes a bit more soft and pliable That said if you live in a country outside of the USA where puff pastry is sold refrigerated instead of frozen no need to let the package thaw you can just unfold and cut it immediately after removing it from the fridge Apples I used Granny Smith apples whose tart flavor and firm texture I love in apple pie filling But feel free to use any type of apples that you prefer peeled or unpeeled cut into either 1 2 inch thick slices or chunks Lemon We will toss both the zest and juice of 1 lemon with the apple which will add a hint of tartness to the filling and help prevent the apples from browning Brown sugar Or you are welcome to use any other type of sugar or sweetener that you prefer Melted butter Half of which we will mix into the apple pie filling and half of which we will brush over the puff pastry Flour To thicken the apple filling a bit Warming spices I used a chai inspired blend of warming spices for the apple filling including ground cinnamon cardamom ginger cloves nutmeg plus some fine sea salt But if you don t have all of these spices on hand you can keep things simple with just cinnamon and cardamom Or you could also use pre made apple pie spice or pumpkin pie spice for the apple filling instead if you prefer Vanilla extract To compliment all of those delicious warming spices in the apple pie filling Powdered sugar To dust on top of the pandowdy before serving

0.0	0.0	Full recipe instructions are included below but here is a brief overview of the process for how to make apple pandowdy Thaw the puff pastry We want the puff pastry to be cool but not frozen for this recipe So in order for it to thaw I recommend setting the frozen puff pastry package on the countertop for about 20 minutes or so while you prepare the apple filling then you can unfold and cut it into bite sized pieces using either a pizza cutter easiest method or a knife Prepare the apples It s up to you whether or not you would like to peel the apples I went the traditional apple pie route and peeled and cut mine into 1 2 inch slices But you could leave yours peeled and or cut them into smaller chunks instead if you prefer We ll also toss them with the zest and juice of a lemon to keep them from browning Combine the filling Once your apples are ready to go gently toss them with the brown sugar half of the melted butter flour cinnamon vanilla extract cardamom ginger sea salt and cloves until combined Then spread the mixture out in an even layer you don t want it to be too uneven otherwise the topping may burn in spots in a 9 x 13 inch baking dish Prepare the puff pastry topping Next we ll sprinkle the puff pastry squares in an overlapping layer atop the apples and brush them with the remaining melted butter so that they will toast up nice and golden Again I recommend pressing down any puff pastry corners that happen to be poking up otherwise they may burn Bake Bake uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes until the puff pastry is lightly golden on top Keep an eye on it though and if it starts to look too dark you can gently lay a sheet of aluminum foil on top of the puff pastry to prevent it from toasting further Then lower the oven heat to 350 F and bake for 30 more minutes until the filling is bubbly Press down the topping Finally use a spoon to gently press the puff pastry topping down into the bubbly filling so that it can soak up some of those delicious juices Don t submerge the puff pastry completely you just want to give it a brief soak Serve warm Then sprinkle with a dusting of powdered sugar serve warm with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and enjoy

0.0	0.0	Here are a few more ways that you could potentially customize this apple pandowdy recipe Make it vegan To make vegan apple pandowdy use a vegan brand of puff pastry and plant based butter Use different fruits This recipe would also work deliciously with pears instead of apples Or you are welcome to add in some fresh cranberries to go with the apples or pears too Use different spices As mentioned above I really love tossing the apple filling with a generous amount of chai inspired warming spices But feel free to keep things simple with just cinnamon and ginger if you prefer or add in any other warming spices that you love Pumpkin pie spice would be another delicious option for the apple filling too Add nuts Feel free to add in a handful of walnuts pecans or almonds to the apple filling if you would like too I don t recommend sprinkling them on top with the puff pastry as they could burn under that high heat Add a caramel drizzle If you would really like to indulge this apple pandowdy would be delicious drizzled with some warm caramel sauce I m especially partial to my bourbon caramel sauce
