0.0	0.0	Ingredients for Spinach and Artichoke Dip Artichokes We use canned and drained quartered artichoke hearts in brine Marinated artichokes are not ideal but can be used Keep in mind they do add more salt and tanginess so add parmesan cheese to taste or your dip may be too salty Spinach Chopped frozen spinach is the easiest to work with Fully thaw according to package instructions then squeeze dry the spinach with your hands to remove excess liquid See notes below on using fresh spinach Jalapeños Canned jalapenos add nice heat without being overpowering It s very mild but the recipe will still work without jalapenos Cream Cheese Sour Cream and Butter These make up the rich and creamy base of the sauce and create an irresistible cheesy sauce Parmesan We use shredded parmesan It melts into the sauce beautifully and adds great depth of flavor Parmesan is the primary source of salt in this recipe since there is no additional salt added so add it to taste Garlic pressing in fresh garlic at the end adds amazing flavor Do not skip the garlic		
0.0	0.0	Can I Use Fresh Spinach		
0.0	0.0	You can make a fresh spinach and artichoke dip One of my readers Victoria shared her very helpful review on that I have made this dip probably a half dozen times or more I have used fresh spinach anywhere from 6 to 10 ounces Works great and so yummy No need to squeeze anything Just trim the stems rough chop and add it in The heat causes it to wilt just enough		
0.0	0.0	Can I Make This a Lighter Dip		
0.0	0.0	I ll admit the original rich version of Spinach Artichoke Dip is so good it makes me weak in the knees but if you re watching calories it is still enjoyable as a leaner appetizer If you are looking for a low fat version of spinach artichoke dip try our Skinny Spinach Artichoke Dip which is made lighter with reduced fat cream cheese and light sour cream or Greek yogurt and less butter

0.0	0.0	Hi Morgan if you have already added the parmesan you could add more sour cream and or cream cheese You can use less parmesan Also some parmesan cheeses can have a sharp off taste You might try a different brand of parmesan I ve had this experience in the past and see if you enjoy it better
