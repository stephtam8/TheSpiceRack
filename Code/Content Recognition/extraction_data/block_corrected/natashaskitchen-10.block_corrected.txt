0.0	0.0	Oh no not sauteed raw We like our onion not only does it add to the crunch but it also takes the away from the blandness not that the sandwich is bland but with avocado you kind of need something to kick it up try it I think you ll like it P S we were sitting in church on Sunday and out of the blue my husband says I want that sandwich with the egg and bacon lol no I didn t tell him about your post I was kind of lost at what to tell him at that moment given that we were listening to the sermon at the time lol Oh and I am obsessed with this board that you have on your picture I have 3 different shapes of the same kind and I treasure them like my diamond ring
