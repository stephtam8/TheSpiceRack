0.0	0.0	Hi Tanya it may work but the butter will probably separate float to the top and firm up so it won t be incorporated into the batter as easily after refrigeration If that happens you will need to get creative to warm the mixture up just enough for the butter to incorporate and blend into the batter again Because of this it s easier to just make the batter in the morning

0.0	0.0	Hi Liliya it won t go bad but the butter will probably separate float to the top and firm up so it won t be incorporated into the batter as easily after refrigeration If that happens you will need to get creative to warm the mixture up just enough for the butter to incorporate and blend into the batter again Because of this it s easier to just make the batter in the morning

0.0	0.0	I have a question have you ever made a whole batch of the crepes and then frozen them for future use Do you think that would work well I ve got three little ones in the house and I m thinking that it would be easier to have regularly if the crepes were made ahead of time

0.0	0.0	Ah all three kids are down napping all under age 3 so I m making these crepes In Hungary we mostly put jam or the cheese filling with raisins in our palacsinta crepes However when we lived in Germany in the early 80 s we discovered Nutella and that it spreads very nicely on still warm crepes palacsinta and that has been my family s favorite filling ever since My mom also makes a crepe and chocolate pudding casserole basically crepes rolled up and laid in rows in a 13 9 pan and then covered with chocolate pudding One time when I went back to Hungary to visit my dad s mom served me meat and cheese stuffed crepes that were breaded and deep fried and then poured over with a tart mayonnaise sauce But I m drooling now so to the kitchen I go Thanks for such a great site

0.0	0.0	to make them I usually use frozen stick of butter for seasoning a pan Works very well Makes 10 12 blinchikov good for 2 people Crapes with cheese could be frozen It s a great breakfast idea for these busy holiday mornings with home full of relatives I guess I need to start making them
