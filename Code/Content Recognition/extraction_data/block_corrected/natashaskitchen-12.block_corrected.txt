0.0	0.0	How to Store Brownies At Room Temperature Brownies can be stored at room temperature in a low humidity environment To keep them fresh and moist cover with plastic wrap directly over the brownies and store in an airtight container for 4 5 days Freezer brownies can be frozen for up to 3 months To keep brownies moister do not cut brownies until you are ready to eat them		
0.0	0.0	How to Serve Brownies		
0.0	0.0	Our favorite way to serve brownies is to top with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream You can also try a dollop of whipped cream drizzled with chocolate or top with fresh raspberries

0.0	0.0	Once you have a great brownie base like this one you can change them up and make them your own Caramel Drizzle the top of the brownies with Homemade Caramel and a sprinkle of kosher salt Walnuts or Pecans chop 1 cup of walnuts and fold them in at the end sprinkling a few over the top for walnut brownies Chocolate Chunks fold in some chocolate chunks in addition to sprinkling them over the top		
0.0	0.0	Can I Bake these in a Different Pan		
0.0	0.0	For this brownie recipe we used a 9 9 square pan Using different sized baking pans will affect the bake times and the recipe These tips should help Bread Loaf Pan Cut the recipe in half and bake as directed for a small batch of brownies 8 8 Pan this smaller pan will result in taller brownies that require a longer baking time 40 48 minutes minutes 12 9 Pan this larger pan works but the brownies will be flatter and will require less baking time 30 35 minutes 13 9 Pan Make 1 1 2 times the recipe or the brownies will be pretty flat Bake about 40 minutes or to your desired doneness

0.0	0.0	Hi Natasha these fudgy brownies are amazing I have made them 3 times and the middle keeps sinking in You suggested that the baking powder was expired so I bought some fresh and was so confident the third batch would be uniform Im using the right 9 9 pan and measuring correctly Im mixing as little as possible Im wondering if using less baking powder and the sides won t rise as much Or the oven temperature might be to cold or too Hot I want to make them again and try to tweek it so they come out better Any further suggestions I poked it with a toothpic to check doneness could that have deflated It I noticed on your video it looked like yours was a touch sunk in as well

0.0	0.0	Hi Debbie I m not sure what else it could be If you suspect your oven runs cold or hot you can adjust the etemperature A toothpick test wouldn t deflate the brownies They normally do have a raised edge but it s not a dramatic difference between the crust and the center I wonder also if it may be the material of the pan For example glass heats up really hot and that could affect how brownies rise at the edges

0.0	0.0	Hi Debbie My brownies sunk in the middle as well I m just wondering my oven is a convection oven and it has no bottom element I don t know if that s common on all convection ovens or not but mine and my sister s oven do not have bottom elements I don t know if that s why our brownies sunk in the middle I didn t use the convection either Also I used a glass baking pan which I never have good luck with I always end up nuking my cakes loafs for a minute or so I just ordered myself a new metal baking pan Hopefully that will solve my problem Janie

0.0	0.0	Hi Alaina it likely sank in the center due to using a smaller pan the sides will get hotter from the pan and rise more which will make it look more like a sunken center Another reader reported great results baking for 45 minutes though I wonder if maybe your oven needs re calibrating if it runs cool

0.0	0.0	I absolutely love love all the recipes I ve made from Natashas kitchen I made the fudgy brownies twice and they came out tasting really good The only thing is they are sinking in the middle First time I used a smaller pan 8 8 and I thought that was the problem I bought a 9 9 and same thing happened They look great when they came out of the oven nice and uniform but When they cooled the middle sank The 9 9 did come out better than 8 8 I measured as instructed used baking powder and did not change any ingredients the top came out beautifully crunchy the taste and Fudginess was great Just the cuts on the edge were taller than the middle Its a gas oven with the heat element on the top Do you know why it Sinks I was afraid to cook it longer

0.0	0.0	These brownies were terrific Fudgy with a shiny crackly top I prefer to bake from scratch but have always gone back to my favorite box mix for brownies because I could never find a recipe that was better This is that magic unicorn brownie recipe I added 3 types of chocolate chips both in and on top of the batter milk chocolate semisweet and bittersweet They are absolutely outstanding Someone asked about using Dutch cocoa I did and it worked fine Dutch and regular cocoa are usually interchangeable The only time it matters is if the recipe has something acidic like buttermilk or sour cream Then you can t use Dutch process cocoa as it will impact the leveling action Also for those that found the brownies too sweet they might try substituting bittersweet chips for the semisweet For my taste these brownies were perfectly balanced Another amazing recipe Thanks Natasha

0.0	0.0	Hi Alena it depends on the recipe and the effects butter would make if it was there Lining the base of your tin with baking paper is particularly helpful if the cake has a wide base and shallow sides such as a layer cake Applying a thin layer of grease to the tin before fitting the paper will help it to adhere to the sides so your mixture can be added without disturbing the paper There are many reasons to be honest but I hope this is somewhat helpful
