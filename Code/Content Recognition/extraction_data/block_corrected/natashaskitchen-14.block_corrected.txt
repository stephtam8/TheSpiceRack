0.0	0.0	The Story Behind This Famous Recipe		
0.0	0.0	On a trip to Maui we visited a fancy restaurant named Monkey Pod The food was awesome but the best thing was the slice of strawberry cream pie we shared at the end of our meal It was tall gorgeous silky as can be and 10 a slice I probed the waitress about it of course I did and she said they mixed mascarpone with whipped cream so I set out to experiment		
0.0	0.0	Their original cheesecake pie had a baked pie crust which I tested but I couldn t resist using this no bake crust It was crazy easy just as good and it makes this a true no bake dessert Most graham cracker crusts are pre baked but the amount of butter here holds the crust together so baking is not necessary at all		
0.0	0.0	Ingredients for Easy No Bake Cheesecake		
0.0	0.0	We tested these proportions over and over until we got the perfect no bake cheesecake consistency It is easy to slice whipped airy rich and decadent The mascarpone is key here it stabilizes the whipped cream and makes this cheesecake taste like a 10 slice at a fancy restaurant Make sure to use FRESH lemon juice It cuts the sweetness and balances the cake A 9 springform pan works best for this recipe		
0.0	0.0	The Best Cookies for a Crumb Crust		
0.0	0.0	A variety of sweet crunchy cookies can be used for a crumb crust and each will give a different flavor profile We used graham crackers because we usually have them on hand but these will all work Graham Crackers Biscoff Cookies Vanilla Wafers Chocolate Oreo Cookies cream removed

0.0	0.0	Hi Natasha So I made your cheesecake today and the flavor was unbelievably delicious The only thing Is that it was not firm like I would have hoped for I had it chilling for more than 24 hours and it was still too soft when I went to cut into it Can you please tell me why this happened I used all the exact same ingredients

0.0	0.0	HI Reva it could be due to using regular whipping cream rather than Heavy cream which has a higher fat content Also make sure to beat the cream sufficiently If it is too soft before folding it with the other ingredients it may not set properly

0.0	0.0	Hi Alicja a couple of things make sure to use the same proportions of crumbs to butter and when putting into the pan make sure not to pack it too tightly which will help Another thing is you can place a ring of parchment paper on the bottom which will help with lift especially if the pan isn t non stick

0.0	0.0	Also it would be wonderful if you could add that mascarpone cheese is prone to curdling so there are no surprises while in the process I read on another blog how it can be salvaged I wish I would ve known that so I wouldn t have thrown away my curdled mixture It would be awesome if you could update your recipe to add extra instructions so our mascarpone doesn t curdle whole mixing together with the heavy whipping cream Still an awesome recipe I will keep going back too and hope that my next tries come out as great thick and tall as yours

0.0	0.0	Hi Betty I m so glad you enjoyed the cheesecake I would double check that all of the proportions of ingredients were the same be sure to measure the ingredients correctly and also make sure to use the correct gelatin unflavored gelatin like Knox gelatin but not flavored jello Also make sure you are using HEAVY whipping cream which has a higher fat content and will help the cheesecake set better

0.0	0.0	Best cheesecake ever The second time I made it I used Biscoff cookies instead of graham crackers I didn t add any sugar for the crust since the cookies were sweet I added about 6 7 T melted butter instead of 8 since the Biscoff cookies were already rich tasting and didn t need more fat Turned out so good And I also freeze individual slices and once thawed it tastes like it was just prepared

0.0	0.0	Hi Elaine I only own 9 springform pans so it definitely was a 9 It could be due to under beating the cream cheese and or underbeating the HEAVY whipping cream be sure to use heavy or it won t beat properly Adequately beating creates a soft fluffy texture and also makes the cake taller I sure hope that helps Also be sure to use the correct amounts of ingredients as listed

0.0	0.0	Hi Aleksandra This recipe doesn t call for sour cream but I honestly haven t tried that The acidity in the lemon cuts the sweetness and balances the cake If you try that I would love to know how you like that

0.0	0.0	So glad I read the comments before making this The heavy whipping cream really is the most important part I hand beat the heavy whipping cream and went until it was a nice thick whipped cream consistency By the time I folded in the mascarpone then the cream cheese and sugar mixture I could tell it was thick enough already to be a cheesecake It s chilling now but based on how good the mixture tasted as well as how yummy the strawberry sauce is I m confident that my boyfriend is going to love this as his birthday cake Thanks Natasha

0.016129032258064516	0.0	Hi Laura you could substitute with cream cheese but I do think mascarpone gives a better texture and overall flavor If using cream cheese I would recommend probably 16 oz cream cheese and 1 1 2 cups of heavy whipping cream and keep everything else the same The mascarpone also helps to stabilize the whipped cream so it s easier to slice	slice
