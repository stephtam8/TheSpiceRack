0.0	0.0	This recipe was first published in June 2012 below is the original photo After testing countless batches we improved the recipe swapping out oil for softened butter and took out the baking soda to create a super soft crumb Everyone agrees these are the best cupcakes Just read the reviews		
0.0	0.0	So which one is the final recipe I don t see oil in the list of ingredients or in your video I hope you can clarify

0.0	0.0	We absolutely love your cupcake recipe It turned out perfectly We will be making them again for my daughter s seventh birthday this weekend I just have two questions for you First question should the toothpick come out perfectly clean meaning no crumbs when checking for doneness I feel like I often overcook my cupcakes mostly because it always comes out with little crumbs when I insert the toothpick so I place it back in the oven Is crumbs very little ones mean it s not done I would assume if it looks wet it isn t ready am I right

0.0	0.0	Hi Jissell you might have some moist crumbs stick to the toothpick but should not have wet batter on your toothpick Gel color should be fine You could put a small amount in a separate dish to see if it is to your liking before applying it to the entire batch of frosting Our Vanilla Buttercream takes on color really well also

0.0	0.0	Hi Lea I haven t tested that with chocolate but I think it could work One of our readers wrote It is super moist and fluffy with a light vanilla flavour After trying out the vanilla cupcakes a few times I decided to ads a tbsp of cocoa powder for a chocolate cupcake and it still turned out great I hope that helps

0.0	0.0	Hi Lakshay I haven t teted that with yogurt but I do recommend reading through the comments One of our readers wrote in Just a side note the reason you need buttermilk or the vinegar milk mixture is because the baking soda will only work if it has an acid to react to producing bubbles which help your cake rise and get fluffy Buttermilk has lots of lactic acid in it you can also easily substitute sour cream or yogurt Just FYI Kefir should work just fine because it does contain lactic acid producing bacteria which ferments the milk much like sour cream or buttermilk I hope that helps
