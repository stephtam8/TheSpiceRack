0.0	0.0	What is Tres Leches Cake		
0.0	0.0	Tres Leches is a popular authentic Mexican cake I am a fan of moist cakes and this Tres Leches Cake blew me away The syrup is made of you guessed it tres leches which means three kinds of milk You poke holes into the cake before pouring over the syrup so every bite is decadently moist The cake is rich but has a light feel to it and is balanced by the lightly sweetened whipped cream We even bravely turned it into a Layered Tres Leches Cake

0.0	0.0	Tres Leches Ingredients		
0.0	0.0	This recipe calls for very simple ingredients most of which are refrigerator and pantry staples It has 3 kinds of milk poured over the cake evaporated milk heavy whipping cream and sweetened condensed milk It s topped with a 2 ingredient whipped cream frosting We love adding fresh berries like strawberries and raspberries over the top for a prettier presentation		
0.0	0.0	Tips for the Best Tres Leches Cake Watch the video tutorial below before beginning to gauge the process and tools needed before starting Measure dry and wet ingredients correctly For the flour spoon it into dry ingredients measuring cup and level off the top Cold eggs are easier to separate into whites and yolks Fold the batter with a spatula just until it is well incorporated then stop Do not overmix since the cake relies on the volume of the eggs to rise While cooling the cake to room temperature avoid any outdoor draft Any egg based cake can take on an eggy aroma if it gets outdoor air Let the cake rest 30 min after pouring on the syrup so it can absorb every drop Bake in a ceramic or glass casserole dish for the best rise and it s easier to serve right out of the casserole dish

0.0	0.0	How long does tres leches cake last You can fully assemble and make a tres leches cake 1 to 2 days ahead Cover and refrigerate overnight Add fresh berries just before serving especially if berries are sliced		
0.0	0.0	Is Tres Leches supposed to be soggy It is supposed to be very moist The cake base is a sponge cake so it takes on the generous amount of syrup without getting soggy This is why I avoid using a boxed white cake mix which can quickly become soggy since it s not meant to absorb liquid		
0.0	0.0	Can Tres Leches Cake be frozen You can make the cake base ahead of time Allow the cake to cool to room temperature then cover the casserole dish tightly with a couple of layers of plastic wrap and freeze the tres leches cake base up to 2 months Thaw the cake in the refrigerator overnight or on the counter before using it It is not recommended to freeze the cake once the syrup and frosting are added		
0.0	0.0	How to Make Tres Leches Cake Preheat oven to 350 F and butter a casserole dish Set up 3 mixing bowls Sift the dry ingredients into the first bowl Separate egg whites and yolks into the other 2 bowls Using an electric hand mixer beat yolks with 3 4 cup sugar on high speed until pale yellow 2 min Stir in 1 3 cup milk and vanilla With clean and dry egg beaters beat whites on high speed until soft peaks form 1 min With the mixer on add remaining 1 4 cup sugar and beat on high speed until whites are stiff but not dry 1 min Pour egg yolk mixture over the flour mixture and use a spatula to blend together Gently fold in egg white mixture until just combined Pour batter into prepared casserole and bake 30 35 minutes When the cake has cooled pierce all over with a fork and slowly drizzle on the 3 milks mixture Let rest 30 minutes then top with whipped cream and berries

0.0	0.0	Hello Natasha This recipe is a winner the way I grew up eating it in Latin America For a little variation in my family we like to add to the syrup mix another 3 4 to 1 full cup of whole milk make it 4 leches but this one I bring to a simmer boil along with a stick of cinnamon Turn it off right away let it cool to room temp then refrigerate Remove the stick and add to the rest of the milk syrup mix It gives a delicious hint of cinnamon along with the vanilla Yum

0.0	0.0	Between 1979 and 1990 the violence of the Nicaraguan Revolution coupled with an earthquake forever changed both Nicaragua and Miami Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans fled the country to Miami a growing metropolis where Latin Americans thrived forged in large part by the Cuban community Much of the population settled in the suburb communities of Sweetwater and Kendall		
0.0	0.0	Today Sweetwater is known as Little Managua which is also where the famous Los Ranchos opened in a small stripmall in 1981 Since then they ve expanded to three additional locations Tres leches cake was added to the menu and thus reintroduced to the Nicaraguan community as well as formally introduced to Miamians

0.0	0.0	Hi Candace some tips it s best not to open the oven when cooking this cake the heat escaping quickly can cause the cake to sink in the center Also try mixing another couple of minutes if you are using a hand mixer or anything other than the highest speed the cake won t rise properly since it relies on the volume of eggs and sugar to rise Also are you making sure to measure your dry ingredients properly I hope that helps

0.0	0.0	Hi Daphne the cake won t rise properly since it relies on the volume of eggs and sugar to rise so I would keep the sugar he same in the cake itself You may try reducing the amount of sugar in the cream and using less sweetened condensed milk in the syrup I hope that helps

0.0	0.0	DELICIOUS This was my first time making a Tres leches cake and this recipe was so simple to follow and took no time at all to prepare I love it because it s not heavy and has the perfect amount of sweetness to it I sprinkled cinnamon on top of the whipped cream layer and berries and it was perfect My only complaint is that the measurements in the recipes for the sauce makes more than what s seen in the video and I ended up having to spill some out of the pan because I was scared it d become soggy as it wasn t all absorbing after a few minutes
