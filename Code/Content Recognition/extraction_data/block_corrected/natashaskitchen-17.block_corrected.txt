0.0	0.0	How to Make Cinnamon Rolls		
0.0	0.0	Homemade cinnamon rolls are easier than you think In fact there is very little active time most of the time required is in letting the dough rise and puff up Make the Dough combine and knead dough for 3 min cover and rise 30 min in a warm spot Roll the dough into a 10 17 rectangle and spread with softened butter Sprinkle on cinnamon sugar and roll tightly into a log Shape Rolls Cut into 12 pieces transfer to a buttered casserole cover and proof 20 30 min in a warm place Bake the rolls Brush tops with melted butter and bake Frost rolls Make the icing and spread it onto warm rolls		
0.0	0.0	How Do I Know When I ve Added Enough Flour

0.0	0.0	Common Questions		
0.0	0.0	Can I use less butter for low fat cinnamon rolls		
0.0	0.0	Butter plays a crucial role in how moist the cinnamon rolls Unless you want a dry cinnamon roll don t skimp on the butter In fact you can throw all modesty out the window and use even more inside the rolls and brush the tops with double the butter		
0.0	0.0	Can I make Cinnamon Rolls ahead		
0.0	0.0	If you re wanting to prep cinnamon rolls the day before and enjoy freshly baked cinnamon rolls in the morning for the holidays or a special occasion check out our Overnight Cinnamon Rolls Recipe		
0.0	0.0	How do I reheat cinnamon rolls		
0.0	0.0	You can quickly warm refrigerated rolls in the microwave for 18 20 seconds The dough becomes soft and the frosting softens and melts like a thick glaze over the cinnamon roll		
0.0	0.0	What kind of flour should I use for cinnamon rolls		
0.0	0.0	Basic all purpose flour works best for cinnamon rolls It has the perfect amount of gluten for super soft and fluffy rolls		
0.0	0.0	Why are my cinnamon rolls dry		
0.0	0.0	Avoid over proofing your dough If you let it rise for too long you will exhaust the yeast and the rolls can fall flat or seem dry when baked Also avoid adding too much flour and over baking		
0.0	0.0	Tips for Working with Yeast		
0.0	0.0	Be sure to use Instant or Rapid Rise Yeast which is a fast acting and quick rising yeast It speeds up the process We use the Red Star Brand Rapid Rise Yeast and you can also use their Platinum Instant Yeast		
0.0	0.0	Heat Kills Yeast and stops the rising process Never overheat the liquids they should be 110 to 115 F and keep the oven under 110 F if proofing in the oven I double check temperatures with an in stant read thermometer		
0.0	0.0	Pro Tip Rapid Rise Yeast and Instant Yeast are used interchangeably and they are not the same as Active Dry Yeast which requires additional activating and proofing		
0.0	0.0	How to proof yeast dough		
0.0	0.0	Yeast doughs require rising times In most cases you can cut the rising time by proofing in a warm place around 100 F to 110 F Oven Proofing If you don t have a low heat proofing setting you can warm your oven to the lowest heat setting for 2 minutes and turn it OFF Set the dough bowl over a towel in the oven to proof just don t forget the towel in the oven Microwave Proofing Place a damp kitchen towel in the microwave and heat on high for 1 minute Cover dough with plastic wrap place in the warm microwave and let rise in the warm microwave with the door closed		
0.0	0.0	Why Isn t My Yeast Dough Rising		
0.0	0.0	If your dough is not rising and puffing up as expected these are the common reasons Too cold set the dough in a warmer place 100 110 F oven Too hot if the oven or milk are too hot it can kill the yeast Old or expired yeast start over with new yeast Too much flour a dense dough won t rise properly
