0.0	0.0	Hi Anne I haven t tried freezing the full assembled cake it does keep in the fridge for up to 5 days but I think that would work fine to freeze but I would cover the sliced portion with plastic wrap so it doesn t dry out or get freezer burn For the frosting it depends on the frosting If it is a buttercream frosting it will freeze better than a cream cheese frosting I would freeze the layers then thaw and assemble them before your event if you plan on freezing part of it

0.0	0.0	Hi Deb I am always happy to help troubleshoot Did you butter the sides of the pan and also use the ring of parchment on the bottom I haven t had that happen but it sounds like it could have been underbaked if it was splitting Did it pass the toothpick test and seem cooked in the center I hope that helps to troubleshoot With this one it s pretty easy to cover up with frosting even if your cake completely broke in half since that frosting is very forgiving and holds the cake together once it s on

0.0	0.0	Hi Christine An uncut frosted cake that s been frosted with buttercream fondant or ganache can last at room temperature for up to five days Keep it covered with a cake keeper or a bowl to protect it from dust or other particles If your cake has already been cut that means moisture is already beginning to escape If you do have leftover cake use plastic wrap to cover the sliced edges or the areas where the cake is exposed

0.0	0.0	Here s a simple chocolate frosting called Cocoa Whipped Cream In bowl combine 1 2 cup white granulated sugar 1 3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 1 5 cups heavy whipping cream You can also add a stabilizer like whip It from Dr Oetker if you like but it is not mandatory Stir together lightly don t worry if it doesn t blend too well Chill the mixture at least 1 hour then beat until stiff This would work well for outside of cake but may not be thick strong enough for the middle layer you could use raspberry jam or Nutella for that This recipe is from the Dessert Cook Book by Better Homes Gardens 1960
