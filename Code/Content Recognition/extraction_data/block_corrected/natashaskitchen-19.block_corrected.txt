0.0	0.0	Why You Should Roast Your Own Chicken		
0.0	0.0	Roasting a whole chicken is easy with minimal prep since there s no need to marinate or brine ahead You don t need any fancy equipment just a roasting pan A freshly roasted chicken is no match for a store bought one that has been sitting under a heat lamp for some time

0.0	0.0	How to Pick a Good Chicken Visual Cues Look for chicken with pink colored meat and avoid any chicken that has any hint of grayish coloring which indicates spoilage Check the Date Use Chicken before the use by date on the package Air chilled chicken a method for cooling chickens that produces the best flavor Organic and Free Range another indicator of a good quality chicken		
0.0	0.0	Chicken Roasting Time Chart		
0.0	0.0	For reference these are the chicken sizes we have experimented with We always recommend using an instant thermometer to double check that it reaches a safe 165 F 5 lb Chicken roast for about 75 minutes at 425 F 5 1 2 lb Chicken roast for about 80 minutes at 425 F 6 lb chicken roast for about 90 minutes at 425 F		
0.0	0.0	If your Chicken is Browning too Much We make a small triangle shaped foil shield to place over the chicken after the first 30 minutes of roasting This keeps the chicken from browning too quickly and ensures a juicy chicken breast We use this same trick to make our Juicy Roast Turkey		
0.0	0.0	How do I Check Roast Chicken for Doneness		
0.0	0.0	I nternal Temperature Use an oven safe thermometer while the chicken roasts or insert an instant thermometer into the deepest part of the thigh without touching bone and it should register at 165 F when done		
0.0	0.0	Juices Run Clear If you don t have a thermometer use a small knife to cut between the leg and thigh going all the way to the bone and you should see the juices run clear		
0.0	0.0	Common Questions		
0.0	0.0	What is the best roasting pan for chicken		
0.0	0.0	We use a 10 15 cast iron roasting pan You can also use a rimmed baking sheet or a large oven safe skillet preferably a heavy cast iron pan		
0.0	0.0	Can I use a roasting pan with a rack		
0.0	0.0	You can roast with or without a rack A pan with a rack allows air to circulate under the chicken and helps the skin to crisp and brown all over Add the vegetables under the rack if using		
0.0	0.0	Do I have to tie the chicken legs		
0.0	0.0	Tying or trussing the chicken with kitchen twine is optional and will make for a nicer presentation		
0.0	0.0	Can I roast frozen chicken		
0.0	0.0	A frozen whole chicken should be fully thawed about 24 hours in the refrigerator		
0.0	0.0	If your oven is smoking		
0.0	0.0	Some ovens get smoky at higher temperatures If yours does reduce the heat to 400 F and cook an extra 10 20 minutes		
0.0	0.0	Can I use an instant pot		
0.0	0.0	Using a pressure cooker is the fastest way to cook a whole chicken Check out our instant pot chicken tutorial		
0.0	0.0	What is the Best Oven Rack Position		
0.0	0.0	Arrange the rack in the lower third of the oven so the chicken is sitting exactly in the center		
0.0	0.0	Love a Crisp Chicken Skin If you prefer crispy skin let your chicken rest without tenting Otherwise the steam under the foil will soften the chicken skin		
0.0	0.0	What to serve with Roast Chicken		
0.0	0.0	Because this is essentially a meal in itself we love to serve roast chicken as the main course To complete your chicken dinner pair it with these sides Mushroom Gravy our easiest gravy recipe or make gravy from the chicken pan drippings like we did our Turkey Gravy Dinner Rolls complete the meal with fluffy rolls Caesar Salad a fresh green salad with homemade dressing		
0.0	0.0	Make Ahead Tips Prepping the Chicken You can stuff butter and season your chicken a day ahead then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to roast Prepping the Vegetables Since potatoes can discolor once they are peeled it is best to cut and season the veggies just before roasting
