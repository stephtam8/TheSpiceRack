0.0	0.0	This classic guacamole is the base for so many awesome variations like Corn Guacamole or even Spicy Guacamole if you wanted to add some heat Watch the video tutorial and you will see just how easy it is to make an incredible batch of guac		
0.0	0.0	It s so easy to master guacamole and once you have this basic recipe down you can experiment with adding your favorite flavors If you re feeling adventurous another combination we love is to replace tomatoes with diced mango like our Avocado Mango Salsa		
0.0	0.0	Ingredients for Authentic Guacamole		
0.0	0.0	Once you have selected your perfectly ripe avocados getting the ratio of ingredients is important for the most authentic tasting guac We use 1 Tbsp of FRESH lime juice for every 1 large avocado The lime juice helps to prevent browning and the right amount will make your guacamole come alive but not literally don t worry		
0.0	0.0	Can I Substitute Lime Juice		
0.0	0.0	Lime juice is the traditional choice but we often substitute lime juice with lemon juice if that is what we have on hand If substituting use the same amount of lemon juice The KEY is to use freshly squeezed juice and never from concentrate or it will taste like boring store bought guac		
0.0	0.0	What is the Best Onion for Guacamole		
0.0	0.0	White onion is the classic choice for guacamole because of its crisp fresh and clean flavor profile You can substitute for yellow onion or red onion like we did with the Corn Guacamole but white onion is most commonly used in authentic guac		
0.0	0.0	How to Select Avocados		
0.0	0.0	When you are buying avocados consider when you will be making your guac If you want guac tonight select perfectly ripe avocados If you are shopping ahead you can get firm avocados and follow our tips below for faster ripening Select Ripe Avocados ripe avocados should have stems attached and you should be able to push the sides in slightly with your fingertips Avoid Overripe Avocados overly soft avocados or avocados with missing stems are more likely to have browned on the inside Tip to slow down ripening or if making guacamole another day store ripe avocados in the refrigerator To Soften Hard Avocados place underripe avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana which releases ethylene gasses to speed up ripening and leave at room temperature for 2 3 days		
0.0	0.0	How to Make Guacamole		
0.0	0.0	We use the same basic process for all of our guacamole varieties and you will have it memorized in no time Pit 3 avocado and use a spoon to scoop them into a mixing bowl then coarsely mash with a potato masher Squeeze lime juice directly over the top to prevent browning Add diced tomatoes cilantro and onion Season with salt and pepper and stir just to combine		
0.0	0.0	Can I Make Guacamole Ahead		
0.0	0.0	Yes You can whip up a batch of guacamole a day ahead Air is the enemy of avocados and will cause it to brown You can preserve your guacamole by placing plastic wrap directly over the surface of the guacamole pushing out all extra air Even if storing in closed tupperware putting plastic wrap directly over the guacamole first will keep it looking green and vibrant		
0.0	0.0	Guacamole tastes best enjoyed within a day or so of making it and we do not recommend freezing since the veggies can get soggy when thawed		
0.0	0.0	Is Guacamole Healthy		
0.0	0.0	Check out the nutrition label below to see the calories and carbs for guacamole Guacamole is naturally paleo gluten free and low carb so it s keto diet friendly Also avocados are nutrient rich and contain a healthy kind of fat You can read more about their health benefits

0.0	0.0	San Diego is the avocado capital of America and I have been enjoying them almost for 50 years I get very annoyed when I open a new one from the grocer and find so many bruised spots squeezing to see if it s ripe I find just holding it in my hand and gently squeezing with my palm will tell me if it is soft inside and just ripe I have also inserted a paring knife tip into it and if it goes in easily it is ripe enough If not just set it aside for another day the knife slit will not hinder it in any way Another tip sprinkle a little Fruit Fresh into the guacamole and it keeps its bright green color

0.0	0.0	I meant grilled chicken breast And yes use Lime instead of lemon If you are in a major hurry someone pops over without calling I just add a good fresh salsa that has been made with all the ingreidients listed use a slotted spoon to get rid of excess liquid add to mashed Avacoda and you are set to go Just make sure its not a brand like Taco bell Buy deli made This saves chopping time
