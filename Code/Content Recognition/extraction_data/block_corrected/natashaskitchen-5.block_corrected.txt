0.0	0.0	This spicy roasted salsa has a nice kick to it but it s not a fiery heat where you re making a mad dash for milk It s just right My parents have tons of tomatoes this year and they re growing faster than we can eat them so we have been testing various tomato recipes		
0.0	0.0	My husband first discovered a variation of this salsa on Foodgawker and it was one of the most gawked of all time He was curious Since then we ve had a steady stream of this salsa in the fridge compliments of my husband it keeps really well in the refrigerator by the way

0.0	0.0	Preheat oven to 375 F 1 Cut tomatoes onions and peppers in half Scrape out seeds from the peppers Peel garlic Lay vegetables cut side up on two baking sheets and roast for 30 minutes or until tomatoes and onions are soft		
0.0	0.0	2 After 25 min move the rack to the highest position set the oven to broil and roast vegetables for an additional 5 minutes The tops of the serrano peppers should start to look charred check on the veggies a couple times to make sure they don t turn too black Remove the baking sheets from the oven being careful not to spill any of the tomato juices that have accumulated		
0.0	0.0	3 Let vegetables cool down a bit then use a food processor to blend everything together along with a bunch of cilantro 1 Tbsp of salt and any tomato juice left in the baking dish feel free to discard tomato juice for a thicker salsa		
0.0	0.0	I had to do it in 4 batches because my food processor is small I m dreaming of a full size one Let salsa cool to room temp if it s not already and refrigerate until ready to serve

0.0	0.0	Hi Dee this one is not designed for canning and I m not sure if processing it in the water bath would adversely affect the consistency or flavor or if there is enough salt acidity to preserve it for canning We always make a ton of this salsa when the garden vegetables are here and portion it in freezer safe ziploc bags for the winter It still tastes completely amazing once it is thawed
