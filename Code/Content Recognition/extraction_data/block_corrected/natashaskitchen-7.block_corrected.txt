0.0	0.0	Everyone touts their recipe as the best however this one is the best I ve tried so far It s easy and delicious and has definitely moist I did have to do some alterations due to 1 I have a severe allergy to casein which is the protein in dairy so I cannot use butter cream milk etc 2 I had 3 very ripe bananas ready to go into bread until our 17 year old ate one Who knew he liked more ripe bananas haha So my slight alterations are as follows in lieu of butter I used coconut oil because I was short a banana I used half of a ripe avocado I happened to have on hand from yesterday I also ommitted the raisins as the 17 yr old hates raisins Since I used avocado I decided to add 1 2 cup of brown sugar Normally I like to test recipes just as they are written but even with my slight alterations this recipe is hands down the best I ve tried I will definitely use this as go to and considering half the bread is already gone I may need to make another one before the weekend Thank you for an excellent recipe

0.0	0.0	Hi Emma could you possibly be using a different size or shape pan Also you might check that your oven is reaching the correct temperature and make sure to put it in the oven after the oven is fully preheated If it didn t rise much it could be the leavening that is expired If leavening expires it won t activate to make the bread rise properly which could be a culprit I hope that helps

0.0	0.0	Love the recipe Have made it several times and turns out yummy every single time Have tried versions without walnuts without raisins and walnuts there is not much difference in the basic taste of course the additions make it yummier Do not hesitate to make it if you don t have walnuts and raisins on hand Also the last 2 times I made it I just used one pot creamed the butter and sugar then eggs and then added the super ripe bananas right in there without mashing them first Since the bananas were very ripe they broke down easily with the electric beater I was using and it saved me from washing more dishes and no difference in taste or texture
