0.0	0.0	Ingredients for Homemade Pancakes		
0.0	0.0	All you need to make homemade pancakes are basic pantry staples that you probably already have such as flour sugar salt vanilla extract baking powder and soda along with some refrigerator staples like milk sour cream and eggs		
0.0	0.0	The Secret to Fluffy Pancakes		
0.0	0.0	These easy homemade pancakes have just the right ingredients to make them nice and fluffy We use both baking soda and baking powder The sour cream in this recipe activates the baking soda and the baking powder helps it rise Perfect for making the fluffiest pancakes		
0.0	0.0	Common Questions Can I use frozen blueberries instead Frozen blueberries work great in this recipe You can substitute raspberries or frozen raspberries as well How do I know when to flip pancakes Pancakes are ready to flip after about 2 minutes on each side You ll know it s time to flip when you see bubbles form at the top and the bottom edges browning If they brown too quickly reduce the heat You want them golden brown on each side and fluffy Can I substitute the sour cream Yes You can use full fat Greek yogurt or regular vanilla yogurt

0.0	0.0	Tips for Success Let them cool down a little before serving The blueberry juice can get very hot If pancakes brown too quickly reduce the heat to allow a full 2 minutes per side I love the lighter flavor of extra light olive oil to saute The best way to reheat leftovers is to pop them in the toaster They are just as delicious as the day you made them Use an ice cream scooper for even sized pancakes

0.0	0.0	Hi Mary the only pancake batter that I have made ahead is one with yeast as a leavening agent I would suggest using this batter once it is made since you will have activated the baking soda and I m not sure it would rise as well if you wait awhile If you wanted to make it ahead the best way would be to combine the dry ingredients in 1 bowl and the wet in another and refrigerate wet ingredients covered Combine the two mixtures just before making the pancakes

0.0	0.0	Oh no That s definitely not normal Did you possibly switch the baking soda and baking powder in the recipe There is enough sour cream to activate the baking soda canceling out any baking soda flavor in this recipe I hope that helps
