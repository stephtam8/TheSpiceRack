0.0	0.0	Hello just wanted to tell you these fluffy clouds have been my saving grace the past few weeks since online learning started kids ask for these everyday I got 4 And they are fluffy and easy and very good with any jam or as I do take 1 cup chopped plums or peaches or any other fruit and 3 4 cup sugar and fry simmer for few mins instant hot jam no need for syrup or powdered sugar it s so sweet and fall like Thank you for a great recipe btw I did try other bloggers buttermilk pancakes but this one beats those only change I make and that s only due to my kids sensitivity to it is reduce the baking powder by 1 2 a tsp Try these u will love them

0.0	0.0	Hi Sabelo It is very likely due to making substitutions in the recipe Have you tried it as written Did you let the milk and vinegar rest for a little bit to allow it to form into a buttermilk before adding

0.0	0.0	I was wondering if there is a way of cutting in half the recipe Would we use 2 eggs instead of 3 Sometimes they are too many and I have tried to save the batter for next morning and for some reason it starts having green spots so I have to toss it

0.0	0.0	Hi Erika I think it would work to cut the recipe down Also I have found that these pancakes reheat pretty well in the toaster if you pre make all of them and then refrigerate Because the batter has quick acting leaveners rather than yeast it doesn t work to store the batter overnight

0.0	0.0	Hi Nelli did you use a whisk to combine the dry ingredients that helps to break it up so you don t get clumps I m not sure why else there would be clumps They do deflate slightly but not too much I wonder if maybe you cooked them over too high of heat and removed them from the pan too soon I hope that helps for next time

0.0	0.0	Hi Mela I haven t tried that substitution but you might googling how to make buttermilk it s just milk and a little vinegar or lemon juice stirred together and let sit at room temp for a few minutes This recipe needs the acidity from buttermilk or homemade buttermilk to activate the baking soda and rise properly
