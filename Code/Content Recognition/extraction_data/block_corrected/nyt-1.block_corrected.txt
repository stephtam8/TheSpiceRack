0.0	0.0	This Bangladeshi style chicken korma named for my mother Amu is gently spiced and enriched with yogurt instead of cream or nuts resulting in a light and bright sauce This style of braising adds very little liquid allowing the chicken to stew in its own juices For full flavor cook the korma until the fat breaks out of the sauce and pools on the surface Keep it traditional and serve with paratha or rice or pull the meat off the bones and pile between mayo slathered white bread to make a chicken korma sandwich and of course cut on a diagonal
