0.0	0.0	A Chinese take out staple hot and sour soup is super easy to create at home and comes together in just 15 minutes This weeknight version bolsters the traditional mushrooms and tofu with the addition of store bought pork dumplings but you could just as easily use chicken or vegetable dumplings depending on your preference Cornstarch gives the broth its velvety texture vinegar adds verve and white pepper adds subtle complexity though black pepper is a perfectly fine substitute Adjust the seasoning with extra soy sauce ginger and vinegar for a more assertive soup
