0.0	0.0	This Minneapolis staple is smart and simple Sealing a slice of cheese inside two thin burger patties allows the burger to develop a serious char while the inside stays moist thanks to its molten core There s debate over whether the burger originated at 5 8 Club or Matt s Bar both have drawn locals and tourists alike since the 1950s The Juicy Lucy method takes some practice you ll need to make sure the edges of the stacked patties are properly sealed so that the melted cheese gushes out with every bite instead of making a mess in the skillet but the results far outweigh the challenge Because the ingredient list is short an unassuming bun a smattering of pickles and a pile of caramelized onions you ll need to season with abandon You may be tempted to use an expensive craft cheese but sliced American cheese is the only way to go for tradition and meltability Alexa Weibel
