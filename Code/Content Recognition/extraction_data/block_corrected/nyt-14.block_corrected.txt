0.0	0.0	At Petit Trois the tiny restaurant in Los Angeles where the chef Ludo Lefebvre serves bistro classics to the film industry and food obsessed this salad serves as an appetizer But it works just as well spread across a platter as a light dinner or lunch and pairs well with a fresh baguette and a glass of chilled red wine Toasting the cumin for the carrots and the crème fraîche is very important but don t worry if you can t find all the herbs for the garnish Just one or two will bring pleasure
