0.0	0.0	This recipe is a version of aglio e olio pasta which is often known as midnight pasta because it can be made quickly with a few pantry staples garlic olive oil red pepper flakes and pasta This recipe takes a bit more time because it calls for roasting the garlic first but doing so adds a complex mellow flavor to the entire dish If you re a planner you could even roast a couple of heads of garlic in advance Roasted garlic will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks and in the freezer for up to two months Add whatever vegetables or proteins look good to you
