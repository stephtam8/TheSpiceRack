0.0	0.0	This fresh soup is a riff on something that a Chinese or Korean mom might make with rice cakes added to bulk it up You can find the white oval disks in most Asian supermarkets they are made with glutinous rice flour and have a chewy texture They are precooked but will rehydrate and soak up more liquid in this soup If you find that they have soaked up too much simply add a little more broth or water to thin out the soup Substituting one to two cups of cooked rice to the soup in place of the rice cakes works well if you don t have access to an Asian grocery store
