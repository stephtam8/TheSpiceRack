0.0	0.0	This is a true oven to table sheet pan dinner full of tender crunchy brussels sprouts and crispy lemony chicken A simple lemon and herb compound butter seasons both the chicken and sprouts which are then topped with thin lemon slices that become crunchy in the oven offering a nice textural element and a bright splash of color and flavor The key is to cut the lemon rounds almost paper thin so they can crisp up and lose their bitterness This recipe is easily adjustable for a larger batch Add 4 drumsticks about 1 ½ pounds to the chicken thighs increase the butter by 1 tablespoon and adjust seasonings as needed
