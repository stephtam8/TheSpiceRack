0.0	0.0	If the flavors of winter could be rolled into one then this meringue roulade would be the result Warming cinnamon burnt honey sweet apples and tangy orange come together to make a dessert fit for the festive season Make sure all your individual components have completely cooled before assembling as you don t want to create any excess moisture in the roulade Get ahead by making the apples and cream the day before then keeping them refrigerated until needed Feel free to make this roulade your own by swapping out pears for apples cardamom for cinnamon or more whipping cream for mascarpone So long as you stick to the basic technique the flavors are yours to play with
