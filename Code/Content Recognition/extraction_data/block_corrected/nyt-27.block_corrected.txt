0.00847457627118644	0.0	Meaty mushrooms simmered with pearl onions wine and carrots make for a rich wintry Bourguignon style stew The quality of the stock here makes a big difference so if you re not using homemade buy a good brand If you re a meat eater beef broth adds a familiar brawny character to this dish but mushroom or vegetable broth work just well especially because the whole dish is rounded out with a tamari for depth For the best flavor use as many kinds of mushrooms as you can get and let them really brown when searing that caramelization adds a lot of depth to the sauce Maitake mushrooms give this a brisketlike texture in a very good way	Bourguignon
