0.0	0.0	Studded with salty olives pancetta and Parmesan that gets golden and crisp at the edges this is roasted cauliflower at its brightest and most full flavored You can serve the caramelized florets either as a vegetable based main dish or a hearty side to roasted meats or fish or big bowls of pasta The recipe calls for using a package of finely diced pancetta that practically melts into the sauce But if you prefer a chunkier texture you can dice it yourself into 1 2 inch cubes and add them with the cauliflower Or to make this vegetarian just leave the pancetta out
