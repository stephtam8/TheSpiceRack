0.0	0.0	What makes these cookies truly perfect isn t anything radical it s simply an attention to detail The pastry chef Ravneet Gill was meticulous in developing her recipe and all of her instructions exist for a reason When she tells you to chill your dough overnight don t think you can skip over that If you do your cookies will spread When she instructs you to roll the dough into balls before transferring them to the fridge to rest do as she says and you ll get a nice plump domed cookie instead of a sad flat one Don t go swapping in milk chocolate for dark and chop the chocolate into large chunks for those dramatic dense puddles of goo One allowance If you don t have Maldon salt another flaky salt or even kosher salt will do Charlotte Druckman
