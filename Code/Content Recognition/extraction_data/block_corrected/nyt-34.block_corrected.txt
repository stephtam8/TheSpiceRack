0.0	0.0	This easy breezy one bowl loaf cake makes the perfect afternoon snack and a perfect breakfast the next day too It s lightly spiced and nut and fruit free but feel free to add about 1 2 cup of chopped nuts or dried fruit if that s how you like your carrot cake There is an optional bit of grated carrot in the lemony glaze which doesn t lend that much flavor but provides a lovely light orange hue If grating carrot for the glaze seems fussy you can certainly skip it
