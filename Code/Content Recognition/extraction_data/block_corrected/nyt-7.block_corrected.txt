0.0	0.0	For a vegan hot chocolate that rivals even the creamiest dairy laden variety add a few tablespoons of nut butter like almond sunflower or peanut to the nondairy milk chocolate chips and cocoa powder Whisking is also essential here nondairy products tend to contain stabilizers that keep them emulsified so they can separate when boiled If you keep whisking the mix as it heats and remove it from the stove when it s nice and steaming but before it boils you ll end up with perfectly smooth hot chocolate Don t worry if it breaks You can simply blend it with a whisk or immersion blender over low heat to bring it back together
