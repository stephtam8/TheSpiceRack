0.0	0.0	The aroma of fresh mint and spices permeates this bright turmeric painted pulao made with basmati rice and ground lamb This recipe which has origins in the ground meat pulaos of India is quite flexible and open to additions a handful of fresh dill a generous sprinkling of fried peanuts or other nuts or crispy fried onions tossed in just before serving It also works well if you substitute beef for the lamb and really needs no sides except maybe some raita creamy plain yogurt or a salad
