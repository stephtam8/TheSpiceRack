0.0	0.0	I like to call this lasagna Super Saucy which honestly I love What I learned through the endless rounds of making it is that if you don t need your lasagna to hold together with awesome sliceability And if you re more the kind of person who is okay with scooping it out with a spoon and straight into your mouth then you are in for a real lasagna treat when you make it the Super Saucy Way		
0.0	0.0	This pan of hot melted cheese I MEAN LASAGNA while not at all clean and tidy like lasagna is supposed to be was actually my favorite it was so saucy so soupy at first but absolute lasagna perfection the next day with just the right amount of moisture and a clean er sliceability once it was completely cooled

0.0	0.0	when you are in Galveston if you have a chance you should check out Shy Katz It is this little breakfast lunch place run by these two women where everything is made from scratch from real food It kind of reminds me of if your blog were a restaurant except that they don t have cauliflower sauce and probably use a lot more butter than you do I am addicted to the shoosh sandwich Mmm Texas toast with grilled chicken plum sauce veggies bacon provolone Oh and if you happen to have room after lunch they have a dessert bar with cakes muffins bars that are all made there and oh so amazing dessert could be a meal in itself and admittedly it has been for me		
0.0	0.0	There are lots of great places for food in Galveston shy Katz is just a little hidden gem not so commercial but a huge hit with locals
