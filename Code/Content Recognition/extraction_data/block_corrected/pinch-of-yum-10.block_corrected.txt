0.0	0.0	But for real for REAL this time THESE COOKIES ARE SO GOOD		
0.0	0.0	Browned butter and brown sugar caramely goodness crispy edges barely thick and soft centers melty little puddles of chocolate chips and sprinkles of just enough salt to cut the sweetness and make you feel like you could probably eat 5 of them		
0.0	0.0	My first favorite thing about these browned butter chocolate chip cookies is that they combine the best of both the thin cookie and thick cookie worlds with that satisfying little crunch around the edge AND underbaked centers that are thick enough to really sink your teeth into Best Of Both Worlds		
0.0	0.0	My second favorite thing about these cookies is that they also just shine and I mean really shine with rich deep caramely flavor thanks to a whole lot of browned butter		
0.0	0.0	At this point in our internet s recipe rich history I try to not add things just for the sake of adding them Which is why for a long time I ve just let our best soft chocolate chip cookies be our best our only our shining star of a chocolate chip cookie recipe		
0.0	0.0	You know I love those cookies And I know you love those cookies		
0.0	0.0	So we have to both know it s a big day when I m willing to present a cookie recipe that is I think as good or even better for certain moments than our original favorite chocolate chip cookies

0.0	0.0	We have a lot of cookies on Pinch of Yum but two of them these brand new browned butter ones and the original best soft chocolate chip cookies are easily tied for being the best		
0.0	0.0	I feel it is my civic duty to give you a full breakdown cookie breakdown on each of these recipes and what makes each of them awesome in their own ways Browned butter chocolate chip cookies these ones you re looking at now These cookies are a work of art They have complex rich flavor They have more of that crispy meets soft and yummy texture They are grown up and almost fancy There is more effort required And the reward is that there is more nuance to both the flavor and the texture Making them is not overly complicated but it s also not mindless These are the cookies for when you need to impress even if the only person you re impressing is yourself on a Wednesday night I feel this is a good time to let you know that this particular cookie dough tastes amazing AMAZING Next level It s where the browned butter flavor comes through the most I m not recommending eating raw cookie dough I m just saying alright Best soft chocolate chip cookies the original POY fave These cookies are unfussy and uncomplicated No fancy steps no unusual ingredients no chill time just a small batch of chocolate chip cookies underbaked to soft thick perfection If I need a quick batch of cookies for friends coming over in an hour these are the ones I m making They have less nuanced flavor than the browned butter cookies and they d be less likely to win a high level baking contest but depending on the moment maybe that doesn t matter I made these recently and gave a few to our nanny and she texted me later that night to say they were the best cookies she s ever had Sometimes basic is best		
0.0	0.0	If I had to pick between the two I wouldn t		
0.0	0.0	I like them both at full 100 liking capacity for different reasons I like to have a cookie for each mood know what I mean		
0.0	0.0	But since today is the day we re sharing these browned butter beauties out into the world today will be the day I say make these ones		
0.0	0.0	The originals will still be there for you when you need them Today is a day to go brown some butter and then experience the rush of sinking your teeth into that crispity edge with the underbaked slightly thick gooey rich center Treat Your Self

0.0	0.0	I was first inspired to make this type of fancier chocolate chip cookie by the browned butter cookie recipe in Sarah Kieffer s book 100 Cookies which by the way is a super fun cookbook for people who love to bake This was the tutorial I used for learning how to properly brown butter from America s Test Kitchen and I also read up quite extensively through the comments section of this Bon Appetit recipe for tips from people who love making cookies with brown butter Print

0.0	0.0	Measuring the flour It s really important to get the right amount of flour here which is why I m going to recommend that you take the time to spoon your flour into your measuring cups and level them with a knife That is not something I typically recommend because I don t have the patience for it but here it really does matter An over floured cookie will be too thick and won t get the crispy edge Watch the video to see the consistency of the dough that we re going for I find that it s easier to go by the feel than by exact measurements since there are so many variables that can affect how much flour you ll need		
0.0	0.0	Browned butter timing If you brown the butter for longer than 5 minutes it ll start to lose moisture which will affect your butter flour ratios I like to transfer my butter to a glass measuring cup after I brown it to make sure I still have very close to 1 cup of butter If you have less it s fine they ll still turn out you just want to scale back on the flour by 1 2 tablespoons if you lost a little of that moisture		
0.0	0.0	Browned butter flecks The browned butter will have flecks of brown in it those are the browned milk solids and they hold all the yummy flavor so be sure to really scrape your pan down so you get to use all of them		
0.0	0.0	Splitting and storing the dough This makes a very large batch of cookies If you don t need all of the cookies at once here s what I recommend split the dough into thirds One third of it should fit onto one large cookie sheet so you can bake that immediately Then store the other two thirds in their own containers and either refrigerate up to 5 days or freeze up to three months and you ve got two more fresh batches sometime in the future You can also freeze the rolled balls or the baked cookies both with great results		
0.0	0.0	High altitude testing a note from a tester Due to altitude I typically add extra flour to get the correct thickness so for this recipe I anticipated needing to add about 3 4T extra flour My browned butter measured about 2 tablespoons shy of 1 cup in liquid form and I ended up needing to add almost 1 2 cup extra flour and refrigerated as instructed
