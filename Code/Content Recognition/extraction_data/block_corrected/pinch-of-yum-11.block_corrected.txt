0.0	0.0	I started a dinner club a few years ago gah seriously feels like yesterday and for this dinner club every month 6 friends my happy self get together for a night of wine appetizers and amazing homemade food We re talking the type of food that we all maybe wouldn t normally make for our families or for our regular weeknight selves but that can be fully embraced and appreciated when we are with our foodie friends		
0.0	0.0	Example gnocchi		
0.0	0.0	About a year ago I learned the basics of making gnocchi at a blog related event and I came home and said listen up dinner club we need to make gnocchi together		
0.0	0.0	I am not exaggerating when I say that our gnocchi night is STILL the talk of our dinner club It will never ever be topped unless it s topped by another gnocchi night There were platters upon platters of that pillowy potato gnocchi and simmering pots of tangy bolognese and creamy marsala mushroom and zippy pesto sauces that still live right at the surface of our food dreams It was a girls night gnocchi event that bordered on otherworldly		
0.0	0.0	So Today s post is exciting for three reasons Comforting wintery love yourself GNOCCHI Superfood vegetables tasting ahhmazing hello sweet potato and broccoli rabe Weeknight ease		
0.0	0.0	Do you believe me Look here		
0.0	0.0	Trust This Is Going To Be EASY		
0.0	0.0	As with most recipes that I make I like them to be NOT OVERWHELMING		
0.0	0.0	With the fancy gnocchi night I boiled dried rested cooled and riced the potatoes before mixing That was a different time		
0.0	0.0	This time we are literally just baking in the microwave Okay Can you get on board with me here Just bake that little sweet potater in your micro for speed and ease mix it with the ricotta Parm and flour and form into cute little sweet potato gnocchi Boil them till they float and voila Gnocchi		
0.0	0.0	These gnocchi are sturdy enough to stand up to the sage garlic butter pan frying situation that follows which is exactly what I wanted them to be golden and crispy on the outside and soft and loverly on the inside		
0.0	0.0	A Little Nutritional Boost		
0.0	0.0	To avoid getting overly sweet and to throw some powerhouse nutrition in the mix we are serving this up with broccoli rabe blanched to tender crisp perfection before getting tossed in to the magic of that saute pan		
0.0	0.0	In addition to being a SUPER HEALTHY power ingredient I loved using broccoli rabe with this because it was kind of like a textural cross between broccoli and spinach You have the leaves of the broccoli rabe which cook super nicely similar to spinach and you have the beautiful barely crunchy florets that are small enough not to overwhelm the dish		
0.0	0.0	Besides the colors		
0.0	0.0	You NEED those bold colors working together in your recipe life		
0.0	0.0	If you don t have easy access to broccoli rabe another green veg will do here like spinach or kale Just throw it right on in that pan Or skip the veg and just enjoy that gnocchi perfection

0.0	0.0	Is there another sauce I can use with this gnocchi		
0.0	0.0	Sure If you wanted to just lighten it up a bit you could use some olive oil with the garlic and sage and create a lighter sauce without cream but we d recommend staying in the garlic sage flavor profile IT S SO GOOD
