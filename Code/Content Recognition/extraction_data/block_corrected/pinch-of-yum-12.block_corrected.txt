0.0	0.0	It s pretty much subconscious at this point when the weather turns colder and the leaves start turning I start craving bowl after bowl of this white chicken chili		
0.0	0.0	This is not just any white chicken chili it is a specifically non authentic cheap thrills style white chicken chili that my friend Sarah made for us a few years ago and it might be one of my favorite soups of all time This chili contains several slices of thick bacon and a full block of cream cheese and thank you for understanding why this is necessary It is altogether creamy and smoky and cozy and spicy and just really wonderful in its big flavorful ness		
0.0	0.0	Sarah is the kind of person who knows the importance of chili toppings and so naturally this white chicken chili is a welcoming canvas for chips cheese cilantro or green onions or hmm let s see EVERYTHING		
0.0	0.0	I can virtually guarantee that this meal is going to have your people bugging you for the recipe I texted Sarah for the recipe after she made it for me and my sister texted me for the recipe after I made it for her this is just how these things work		
0.0	0.0	There is some amount of adjusting you can do here pick the type of beans you like pick the type of chicken breasts or thighs that you like etc but I really do not recommend messing with the bacon or the cream cheese Both are super essential for the creamy smoky Tex Mex queso type vibe that you re going to get with this soup		
0.0	0.0	The number of bowls of this white chicken chili that I ve eaten on the couch in front of the TV loaded with chips and cheese and green onions after a long day really just living my best life It s too many to count High and still rising

0.0	0.0	Salt I didn t include a salt measurement here or even a mention of seasoning because I find that with both the bacon AND the chicken broth it is plenty salty But you do you		
0.0	0.0	Beans This white chicken chili is also great with white beans navy beans and red beans Mix and match as you like And for a less chunky soup use just one can of beans		
0.0	0.0	Bacon grease The overall amount shouldn t be overwhelming as there is no other oil in this recipe and the bacon grease will work its way into leftovers nicely with really good flavor That being said I often just quickly skim the top if when I start to see some of the grease pooling If you want you can drain off the extra tablespoon or so of grease after you fry the bacon with the onion garlic and jalapeño in step two
