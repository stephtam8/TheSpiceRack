0.0	0.0	I see you hungry reader whose life is crazy right now who has a hard time finding the time to cook even though you love food who opens the fridge to grab a quick lunch to take to work in the morning rush only to find NOTHING that seems good enough who values the big bowl of comfort food pasta above all else who is not asking for much other than GOOD FOOD that is made for REAL LIFE		
0.0	0.0	I see you I know you think I m not watching because I m on the other side of this computer ma jig but I m watching um in a not creepy and not literal way just felt like I should clarify pls don t leave		
0.0	0.0	So since I see you and understand you because I am just like you in these feelings today I honor you us with this super cozy big time nutritious easy to prepare soup		
0.0	0.0	This is called Detox Crockpot Lentil Soup which means nothing scientifically as you ll notice that my bowl of DETOX soup is topped with a few thick chunks of Parmesan cheese and served with that addicting crusty warm bread Right about that We did sneak a few good foods into this soup kale onions garlic carrots and olive oil and anyways in my book the best kinds of healthy foods are the ones that ACTUALLY TASTE GOOD		
0.0	0.0	And while this soup tastes good without the extras it tastes BETTER with them Cue the bread and cheese		
0.0	0.0	What Makes This Lentil Soup So Good		
0.0	0.0	As is my goal with most recipes I make for Pinch of Yum this crockpot lentil soup was made for real life Because it s literally for my real life		
0.0	0.0	We re starting with a solid base onions garlic carrots celery spices salt and broth		
0.0	0.0	Then we re getting awesome by adding butternut squash which partially melts into a creamy textured miracle lentils always lentils and yellow split peas because WOW color		
0.0	0.0	After all this simmers up into the best house smells and then we do the magic thing that takes it over the top puree a portion of the soup with that olive oil to form a silky emulsion that then gets added back into the soup YES PLZ 4EVR		
0.0	0.0	I ended mine with a splash of sherry and red wine vinegar because I m currently having a moment with tangy foods		
0.0	0.0	What to Serve with Lentil Soup		
0.0	0.0	There s a lot going on in this soup but if you want to round it out for a whole meal I d recommend a few extras No Knead Bread YES No Knead Cheese Bread DOUBLE YES One Ingredient Socca yummy gluten free flatbread for dipping purposes A simple green salad like this one		
0.0	0.0	That s it That s the soup SO EASY It requires a bit of front end chopping to prep the veggies but I d guess it took me 30 45 minutes to cut everything up and get it in the crockpot and in return I was gifted with 8 soup servings of this nutritious cozy wonderfood NOT A BAD DEAL

0.0	0.0	Yes I would use them in place of the squash so that it doesn t get overly sweet the squash itself is already pretty sweet

0.0	0.0	Hmm we re not sure that red lentils would work well here since like you said they cook faster and might overcook if you cook the soup for the same amount of time You could try cooking the lentils separately and adding them to the soup once everything is done

0.0	0.0	I do if you turn it on low It gets mushy anyways like the squash sort of breaks down which is why the broth is more creamy and yellow Otherwise if you re really nervous I would make it on a weekend it makes so much that then you d have it for the week
