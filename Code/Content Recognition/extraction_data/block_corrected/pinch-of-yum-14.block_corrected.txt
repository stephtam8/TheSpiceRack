0.0	0.0	How These Cookies Came to Be		
0.0	0.0	A loooong time ago when we were living in the Philippines I accidentally discovered my new favorite way to make cookies The recipe is many many years old but if you like to creep they can be located here		
0.0	0.0	And let me just take a moment to acknowledge that seriously without fail everything good that I make is always inspired by haphazard accidents including but not limited to broken refrigerators and lacking ingredients and my really strong tendency towards laziness Everything including these cookies and all their iterations		
0.0	0.0	So in 90 bajillion degree Cebu Philippines back in fateful 2012 yes I WAS trying to bake chocolate chip cookies In true Pinch of Yum must have the food now style it made 0 rational sense I had butter that was literally melted from sitting out on the counter for like three seconds I had NO brown sugar and I added a little too much extra flour I proceeded to bake the accidental cookies in my oven which I had to start by lighting a FIRE with a MATCH inside of it and which had NO TEMPERATURE MARKINGS other than the numbers 1 5 I am laughing out loud over here howwww did I do anything		
0.0	0.0	What Makes Them The Best		
0.0	0.0	So where were we I think we were about to count the number of cookies I ve eaten as I ve refined this recipe which is approximately censored		
0.0	0.0	I ve always loved that old Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe but I ve always kind of been annoyed about it too Like why does it need to melt only half of the butter Does it really not work to melt ALL of it And why does it need the spoonful of brown sugar Or does it Sheesh how annoying is the person who wrote that recipe anyway WOOPS		
0.0	0.0	Now for the good news		
0.0	0.0	I replicated the ULTRA THICK ULTRA SOFT texture it called for bold right and maybe even improved the flavor with this version that is similar but way easier and more sensible than the original		
0.0	0.0	And by sensible I mean just like lazy sensible okay I don t mean THAT kind of sensible You might need to start looking for another blog if you need your cookies to be sensible		
0.0	0.0	There is nothing sensible about this beautiful sugar and butter perfection		
0.0	0.0	We re always trying to eat a little better around here Right Maybe		
0.0	0.0	But there is one thing that I love more than anything in the world yep going there and that is a really good thick soft chocolate chip cookie with a glass of milk		
0.0	0.0	Today tonight whenever it is if you re going to eat a cookie please make it count		
0.0	0.0	Please make it a soft hugely huge and always soft and buttery and chocolate chippy and perfectly soft did I already say that chocolate chip cookie that will take your life to the next level

0.0	0.0	Common Questions About Chocolate Chip Cookies		
0.0	0.0	Why did my cookies flatten		
0.0	0.0	The three most important things about this recipe are 1 Melting the butter 2 Adding enough flour and 3 Not baking for too long If you find that the dough is wet and it REALLY sticks to your hands you probably need more flour I ll usually add a few tablespoons at a time to get it to the right consistency See the video in this post for reference as well as the cookie chart in the recipe card		
0.0	0.0	Why are my cookies so puffy		
0.0	0.0	This usually means that there s too much flour in the dough keeping them from spreading more Be sure to always measure your flour correctly spooning it in to the measuring cup vs scooping from the bag Since you can always add more it s important to not over flour to start with See the video in this post for reference on the correct consistency		
0.0	0.0	Can I freeze chocolate chip cookie dough		
0.0	0.0	Yes Roll them up into balls freeze them on a sheet pan and then keep them in a bag in the freezer until ready to bake We d recommend letting them thaw on a sheet pan covered before baking		
0.0	0.0	Can I make these gluten free		
0.0	0.0	We ve never tried it with this recipe but I m sure you could If you have a favorite 1 1 gluten free flour that s probably your best bet We d love to hear how it goes		
0.0	0.0	How should I store the cookies after baking		
0.0	0.0	The cookies can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for 3 4 days or in the fridge for a week We like the fridge method to keep them fresh Print

0.0	0.0	Apple sauce is not a substitute for butter While it might make sense in a recipe where the butter simply adds a bit of smoothness to the recipe pancakes for example but not where butter is the MAIN INGREDIENT You need to qualities of butter which are among other things semisolid at room temperature Try coconut oil for a healthier alternative to butter when making cookies But keep in mind that coconut oil becomes liquid at around 70 degrees F so those cookies might actually have a better texture when served cold

0.0	0.0	They both have pros and cons However coconut oil is high in natural saturated fats Saturated fats not only increase the healthy cholesterol known as HDL in your body but also help to convert the LDL bad cholesterol into good cholesterols By Increasing the HDL s in the body it helps promote heart health and lower the risk of heart disease		
0.0	0.0	So I don t know what you are talking about You sound uninformed to me		
0.0	0.0	Also I love butter There s nothing wrong with using either option it just comes down to what you want how you feel what you have available etc I didn t have eggs available and I had just enough apple sauce to make the recipe work so it s technically vegan I didn t plan that out on purpose I m just too lazy to go to the grocery store today Apple sauce has some good stuff about it and so does eggs I m not sure it really freaking matters which is healthier
