0.02142857142857143	0.0	VERY good recipe base I made this for a late lunch Had a bunch of cauliflower in the fridge that was about to go bad so I saved what I could and riced it in the food pro Easy instructions good video I used Trader Joes meatless italian sausage pescatarians and added a splash of white wine with the tomato paste for flavor Also added lemon zest juice with the parsley at the end I ll be making this again for sure but will probably use some frozen riced cauliflower to make it even quicker And maybe add some leftover rice quinoa for some heft Super fun take on a recipe and so much easier to do in the oven I watched a show while this roasted Thanks for sharing this got rave reviews and I will definitely make again	of lemon juice

0.0	0.0	Execellent recipe I m on strict keto so 12 crabs is pretty steep for me for one meal However this was worth it I cooked the sausage onion and red pepper separately from the cauliflower to ensure the texture would be adequate for me The addition of butter to finish off the dish was perfect Thank you for a great substitute of the real thing I ll look forward to more recipes
