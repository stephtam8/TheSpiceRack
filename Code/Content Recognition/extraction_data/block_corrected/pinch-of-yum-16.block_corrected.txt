0.0	0.0	No no no This is not arroz con pollo Please don t call it that Arroz con pollo is originally from the Caribbean islands we don t use jalapeño The base of the arroz con pollo is using something called sofrito which is made from scratch by blending cilantro recao sweet red peppers onions garlic this sofrito or cilantro base is used in the beginning not at the end like you did Then using anatto sazon and adobo for the seasoning of the chicken as well as a bit of cumin and a bit of oregano We never use as much cumin as you used You also put a spoon of tomato sauce or tomato paste Put a few olives in to cook with the rice not after Also do not put the pot of rice in the oven it will come out too sticky and watery as I see yours came out it should be fluffy which just a bit of stickiness not watery
