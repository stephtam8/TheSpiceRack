0.0	0.0	How This Pumpkin Bread Came to Be		
0.0	0.0	Baking used to be my favorite thing it s actually why I started the blog I baked almost every Saturday morning in our little condo kitchen with the terribly yellow overhead lights and the 1970 s oven and loved every second of it My first blog post was actually a pretty average recipe for chocolate chip muffins in which I forgot to list the CHOCOLATE CHIPS Humble beginnings		
0.0	0.0	As much as I loved baking as Pinch of Yum started to become more of a thing like a this is my job thing I started to feel like the meal time recipes were most valuable to myself and others rather than just baking recipes I found that the people who were reading my little blog were hungry aaaa get it for yummy meal recipes maybe even more than they were for baking and desserts Meal time recipes were what people wanted they were something I enjoyed they was performing well for the blog		
0.0	0.0	All of this led me to a place where I kind of put baking on the top shelf for a while still there but just out of reach		
0.0	0.0	But why That s sort of what I ve been asking myself lately as I ve realized my need to stay in love stay fresh stay grounded with what I m doing So in the last two months I ve been re introducing baking into my life as I try to really get back to the core of loving food and cooking		
0.0	0.0	Whether cooking or baking from the basic weeknight dinner recipes like the pumpkin spaghetti I ve been eating for the last 900 meals straight to this homemade pumpkin bread that is just really really delicious even when it s not embellished upon at all it all just feels so nourishing in my own personal little season of food work life inspiration Fall is good for us like that		
0.0	0.0	And regarding the mention of pumpkin recipes back to back You know I m not even sorry about it		
0.0	0.0	Moist Delicious Simple		
0.0	0.0	Today s pumpkin bread as the obnoxious title suggests is deliciously moist The most important quality of a good pumpkin bread IMHO Really in any good bread see also another deliciously moist favorite in this Lemon Poppyseed Zucchini Bread		
0.0	0.0	It isn t made with any homemade oat flours or egg substitutes or honey in place of sugar because that s just not where I m at with food right now Where I AM at is getting back to the love of the food and the love of the food in this pumpkin bread is eggs oil flour pumpkin and real sugar		
0.0	0.0	If er when you feel like you just need to ground yourself in the basics of life food and the beauty of changing seasons this basic awesome deliciously moist pumpkin bread is here for you		
0.0	0.0	And look Even though it really doesn t need anything you can if you so desire put butter all over it And honey

0.0	0.0	Common Questions About This Pumpkin Bread		
0.0	0.0	Can I make this gluten free		
0.0	0.0	Probably Use your favorite 1 1 GF flour that s best for baking or check out our gluten free Favorite Pumpkin Muffins here		
0.0	0.0	Can I make this with less sugar		
0.0	0.0	Sugar is part of what gives the bread moisture You can cut the amount of sugar but it will affect the texture and dry the bread out a bit For the most yummy and moist version use the full amount It ends up being about 1 2 tablespoons sugar per slice		
0.0	0.0	Can I use just one type of oil for this		
0.0	0.0	You can just use one type of oil I liked using both because it gave a very subtle olive oil flavor without being overpowering		
0.0	0.0	Why two loaves		
0.0	0.0	Because why not But seriously one for you one for a friend or in the freezer for later		
0.0	0.0	Is that amount of salt correct		
0.0	0.0	Two teaspoons seems like a lot of salt but it really helps the flavor of the bread pumpkin spices even sugar come through

0.0	0.0	Sorry to hear that Erin It s so hard to say for sure what may have went wrong It could be due to the difference in ovens damaged outdated baking soda overmixing the batter or letting the batter sit too long before baking

0.0	0.0	I made a few changes to this recipe to make it refined sugar free and it still turned out perfectly I replaced the sugar with maple syrup and removed the water and half of the milk I also omitted the butter and sugar topping It did seem to need a little extra time cooking maybe because it didn t have the butter I think I ended up leaving it in for a total of 50 min		
0.0	0.0	Here s an ingredient list if anyone else is interested in making it this way 4 eggs 1 2 cup vegetable oil 1 2 cup olive oil 2 cups pure maple syrup 1 15 ounce can pumpkin not pie filling just regular pumpkin purée 1 4 cup milk 3 1 2 cups all purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking soda 2 teaspoons salt 1 heaping teaspoon cinnamon
