0.0	0.0	I agree the nutritional info doesn t make sense I think you could easily cut back on sodium by using salt free tomatoes and broth Plus reduce calories fat by reducing the amount of cheese and or using light feta Also reduce the amount of bread butter and oil It would still be delicious

0.0	0.0	Serendipity that this recipe arrived in my inbox today I was finishing processing the last of my garden Romas had frozen shrimp and a hunk of feta Fantastic flavor I dumped a tablespoon of fresh mint and thyme in at the end because I had no parsley and served with capallini as no bread pretty fancy and didn t need a trip to the store
