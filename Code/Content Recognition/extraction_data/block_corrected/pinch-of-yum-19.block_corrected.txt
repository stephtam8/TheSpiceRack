0.0	0.0	Common Questions About This Tomato Soup		
0.0	0.0	Why crush the tomatoes by hand		
0.0	0.0	The main goal here is to use higher quality tomatoes and usually whole canned tomatoes are higher quality whereas pre crushed tomatoes are made from bits and pieces of lower quality tomatoes That being said I ve made this without hand crushing the tomatoes either using crushed canned tomatoes or breaking apart the tomatoes in the pan with a spoon and it s still delicious		
0.0	0.0	How can I make this vegan		
0.0	0.0	Skip the bacon use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and skip the cream at the end or throw a handful of cashews into the blender with the soup to make it creamy		
0.0	0.0	Can this soup be frozen		
0.0	0.0	Yes It should keep in the freezer for 3 4 months		
0.0	0.0	Can this be made in the Instant Pot		
0.0	0.0	Yes Follow the recipe as is using the sauté function on the Instant Pot and then instead of simmering for 30 minutes cook it on manual high pressure for 15 minutes with a quick release at the end Blend add your cream and serve Print

0.0	0.0	I am not a very good cook but making this soup made me appear to be a culinary genius in the eyes and tastebuds of my family I forgot to buy fresh basil so I opted for dried It was fine but you know there is nothing better than fresh basil The slightly smokey bacon flavor is the signature flavor in this soup LOVED IT I was fortunate to have a killer immersion blender and it earned it s money Blending the soup with the immersion blender in the pot without having to pour batches into a processor was a super time and mess saver for an amateur like me

0.0	0.0	This is the best tomato soup that I have tasted And this says a lot because I love tomato soup I used real tomatoes from the farmers market trust me they are so much better than grocery store tomatoes by blanching them first which removes the skins chopping them into cubes and then cooking the whole soup on medium heat for 25 minutes I also added turkey stock instead of broth and 3 tablespoons of butter Will absolutely be making again and would suggest real tomatoes Thanks for the recipe
