0.0	0.0	Okay making these right now for those wondering about melted butter as in the video vs softened as the recipe calls for here s the deal Both will work Softened butter will be easier to roll the dough immediately Melted requires you to put the mixture in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to firm up I melted my butter and also found it easier to put a small amount of flour on my hands to help prevent sticking Currently baking I am sure they will be perfect

0.0	0.0	Okay some further follow up I used a 2 tbsp cookie scoop and these bad boys are HUGE I would definitely use a 1 tbsp scoop next time Not only to make them more manageable but also to make the recipe go further As it stands I will get ten completed sandwiches Considering cutting each cookie in half and making half moon sandwiches to make it go further trying to fill Christmas cookie tins If you decide to go for gold and do the 2 tbsp scoops definitely only put 9 on a sheet pan otherwise your cookies will spread and bake together

0.0	0.0	These have been a family favorite for years The recipe I have uses 2 boxes of cake mix and ingredients to approx the same amount of frosting A fun thing to do with these is to use a mini cookie cutter and punch out a shape on the top cookie just after baking We have a mini heart pumpkin star and pine tree Then you put sprinkles in the mini cut out for color Usually I tint all the frosting pink for valentine cookies
