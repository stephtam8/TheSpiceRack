0.0	0.0	As someone who cooks with cashews a lot for sour cream cheese sauces etc I think it s got to be raw It creates more of a creaminess without the cashew flavor Then you can add the nutritional yeast to it or whatever else and it will combine with that taste to make a creamy cheese sauce pasta sauce sour cream or whatever

0.0	0.0	I made this pasta dish last weekend i used raw cashews and followed the recipe exactly It was AMAZING I had the leftovers 3 days later didn t need to add water and it tasted just as good if not even better The only thing that could possibly make it better is if it had fewer calories
