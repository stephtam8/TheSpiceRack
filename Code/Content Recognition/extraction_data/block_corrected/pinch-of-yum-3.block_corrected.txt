0.0	0.0	Yep I m not really sure it s necessary to use the curry powder I was just kind of grabbing spices and dumping them in so you could probably get by fine with the curry paste because that s where most of the flavor comes from

0.0	0.0	You could use any kind of lentil but it will taste different Brown lentils are firmer and have an earthier flavor Green lentils can take longer to cook and are also firm Red and yellow lentils have a soft texture and sweeter flavor so they re more suited to curries like this

0.0	0.0	Hi Lydia First off were your lentils purchased recently The older lentils are the longer they take to cook After a certain period of time they don t cook fully at all Secondly make sure you have enough liquid present for the lentils to soak up Lastly time Simmer them on the stovetop for a long time or put them in the crockpot Hope that helps Good luck
