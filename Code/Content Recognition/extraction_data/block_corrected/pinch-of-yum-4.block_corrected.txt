0.0	0.0	The sausage gravy recipes i use call for the flour to be incorporated into the sausage before slowly adding the milk Is there a particular reason you wait until the gravy is thickened to add the sausage and green chili PS I can hardly believe I ve never thought of adding green chilis to my gravy Thanks for the tip
