0.0	0.0	This is definitely what I was looking for I don t have a coffee maker so subbed approx 6oz instant coffee I know I know Just like the real thing this was a little too thick and sweet for me so I m probably going to reduce the chocolate and syrup next time and or add more coffee I usually reduce by 1 2 pumps at Sbux There are a lot of DIY peppermint mocha recipes out there but this one seemed to have the right balance of being approachable and seeming to have the right ingredients Glad I found it
