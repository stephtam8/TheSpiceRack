0.0	0.0	I based this recipe off the Vegetable Korma recipe from a 2008 cookbook called Best Ever Indian Cookbook by Mridula Baljekar which is just a gem of a book It has always been one of my favorite sources for Indian recipes because of the step by step photos and every recipe I ve tried over the years has been awesome and there have been many The changes I made from the original include subbing some ground spices in place of whole spices and adjusting the veggie to liquid ratios a bit For a more in depth look at Indian food including influences methods definitions and more check out this amazing post called Indian Cooking 101 by our friend Anu from Simmer to Slimmer Print
