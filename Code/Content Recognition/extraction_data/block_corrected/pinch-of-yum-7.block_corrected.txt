0.0	0.0	Friends let the record show that I am in your club I am on that team I have less than zero percent patience for bread recipes and therefore I do not make bread at all ever and I only have two teeny exceptions I make brioche from Artisan Bread in 5 like three times per year because it makes for perfect tea rings and homemade French toast bakes and cinnamon rolls and for the times that the baking diva within comes alive Also it s VERY EASY I make this Miracle No Knead Bread inspired from my friends fellow bloggers and people of the internet and I make it a minimum of 250 times every fall and winter because it is the opposite of fancy Which is confusing because it FEELS fancy to pull a loaf of homemade bread out of the oven especially when it is tucked into that rustic and beautiful Laura Ingalls Wilder esque red Lodge Dutch Oven affiliate link that we swoon over every year when the leaves start turning but seriously I would and do on a regular basis make this bread for weeknight dinners We don t call this Miracle No Knead Bread for nothin

0.0	0.0	Hi Sam The dough should feel quite sticky and goopy after it has rested for 12 18 hours so I feel like you may have been on the right track Use a rubber spatula to help you peel it away from the bowl and dump it onto the parchment paper Even once it s on the parchment ready to go in the Dutch oven to bake it should still be quite gloppy and flat Please let us know if you have any additional questions
