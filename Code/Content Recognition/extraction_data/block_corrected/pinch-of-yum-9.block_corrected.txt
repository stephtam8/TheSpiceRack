0.0	0.0	Now Onto the Sweet Potato Casserole Base		
0.0	0.0	The sweet potato mixture is as easy as mixing up a muffin batter it starts with sweet potatoes canned which I know seems so retro and perfect and that s because it is I ve made this with non canned sweet potatoes and the weight of baked or boiled sweet potatoes is just too heavy trust me on this one and then eggs butter milk sugar and vanilla

0.0	0.0	Can I use fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned sweet potatoes		
0.0	0.0	Yes We actually enjoy the texture of the canned sweet potatoes here but fresh would work as well Would recommend baking instead of boiling if you go the fresh route as to not add more moisture		
0.0	0.0	Why are there eggs in this		
0.0	0.0	The eggs in the sweet potato casserole are what binds it all together without making the base too heavy Without them the casserole wouldn t be quite as fluffy and scoopable

0.0	0.0	We couldn t have explained it better than Bon Appetit here In this recipe we re technically using orange sweet potatoes

0.0	0.0	Yep that should work just fine Prep it all as listed and you can refrigerate for 1 2 days before baking If you want to make it even better you could also wait to sprinkle on the topping until it s time to bake		
0.0	0.0	How can I make this a vegan sweet potato casserole

0.0	0.0	Yes if you double it I d bake it a bit longer Just check it periodically it is going to be mushy even when fully baked but judge it based on the topping should be pretty deep brown and crisped up a little bit when done Any yams will work We use the Nature s Pride old school looking can with sweet potatoes in it I believe there might be some syrup in there

0.0	0.0	We have done something similar for close to 40 yrs I really think the apple pie spice makes it yummy Although sometimes difficult to find you can substitute some cinnamon nutmeg ginger cardamom etc I also make a double batch of the topping because it is crazy good We often bake the casserole the day s before let it cool and refrigerate I usually pull it out of the oven a bit early just so it won t burn the next day when I re heat it So you re heat it for a few minutes in the oven then make the topping sprinkle on top and toss it into the broiler This frees up your oven for some of the other holiday dishes Whichever MAGICAL recipe you make you will LOVE it I usually have half a bite of regular mashed potatoes on my fork with half a spoonful of the sweet potatoes Mouth watering NOW Oh and the leftovers if there are any can be heated in the microwave DO IT You will be the hit of the party even with people who normally don t like gasp sweet potatoes I use a 13 9 dish I like having more surface area for the topping Sweet Potato Soufflé 3 eggs 2 ½ c canned sweet potatoes drained mashed ½ stick butter 1 1 2 c sugar ¾ c evaporated milk 1 3 c water 1 t apple pie spice 1 t vanilla extract Preheat oven to 350 degrees Mix ingredients together until almost smooth Bake 1 ½ hours or until inserted knife comes out clean Broil 1 min with topping I double the topping recipe This is a single recipe below Topping 2 T sugar 2 T flour 1 t apple pie spice ½ c chopped nuts 2 T margarine or butter softened

0.0	0.0	Thank you so much for sharing these recipes and for the work you put in to the blog site and giving the little details to ensure we have a successful turnout on our recipe attempts I m always so grateful for these resources we have available to us thanks to other people s time and efforts Ihave to confess kind of drives me a little tiny bit or a lot crazy when someone comes to the reply section and uses it as their platform to indirectly critique someone else s efforts by elevating their own agenda and knowledge about how they already know all you ve shared have a better way of doing it a better name to call it and suggest so many substitutions or exchanges that it completely changes the recipe It s confusing to the followers and just seems a little or a lot out of place Don t get me wrong I don t mind helpful additional thoughts or ideas that stem from an original post such as helpful tips or minimal substitutions that might be useful in place of an ingredient harder to find or a crunchier option for those who have more organic items on hand But all of that can be done with tact class social ediquette while keeping the writer s recipe at the center of the post without using the reply section as a whole new platform for their own recipes and opinions Changing your recipe completely comes across as an attempt to one up or belittle the writers efforts and tends to give the impression That they feel their ideas or recipe are in some way superior and deserve a place on your blog I have no doubt that other people have similar recipes with some great ideas But they fortunately also have the same opportunity and resources available to start and write their own food blog without having to take the easy way out of the work and instead trolling others sites to promote or brag on themselves Just my two cents You guys don t always get the appreciation you deserve Thank you for this and I will be trying it just as shared without 13 other spices and alterations Would it even be the same recipe if I did that LOL Thanks again a lot of time and work goes into what you do
