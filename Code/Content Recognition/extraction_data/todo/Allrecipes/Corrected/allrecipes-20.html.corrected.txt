Sweet and Savory Sausage Cornbread Stuffing

Ingredient Checklist
1 (16 ounce) package Jimmy Dean® Premium Pork Regular Sausage
½ cup salted butter
2 cups diced onion
2 cups diced celery
1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms
1 teaspoon dried sage
1 teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground black pepper

Instructions Checklist
Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
Add sausage to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir with a spatula, breaking apart the sausage until cooked, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and set aside.
Melt butter in the same skillet. Cook onion and celery, stirring constantly, until onion is soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Season with sage, salt, and pepper. Stir in sausage, cornbread, bread cubes, and chicken broth.
Transfer stuffing to a 2-quart baking dish.
Broil in the preheated oven until the top is toasted and starts to brown, 2 to 4 minutes.
