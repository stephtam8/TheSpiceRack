1. As a home cook, I want to store my recipes in a database, so that I can access them at a later time when I would like
   to make the recipe.

2. As a home cook, I want to see a grocery list made of my recipes, so that I can see all the ingredients that I would
   need to get at the grocery store for the recipes I would like to cook.

3. As a person who uses online recipes a lot, I want to have a source where I can avoid numerous ads and pop-ups, so
   that I can access recipes immediately and efficiently.

4. As a person who has grown up with recipes passed on from older generations, I want to be able to have a way to access
   these recipes online, so that I can share them with others and not have to search for a physical copy of them.
